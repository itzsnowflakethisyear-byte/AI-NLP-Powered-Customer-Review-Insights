1,Third time is the straw. My order was missing the main topping. Salami of all things! You would think I would learn. Unfortunately I order through the app and this is the store I am required to use. The manager was not interested at ALL in fixing the problem! It didn't show on their end so not their problem! Screw customer service! I say screw them. Cold day in hell  before I order from them again!,Complaint,0.98
2,It use to be good food I always order there. two large cheese pizza and the whole thing was burnt I didn't even call them because they don't care. This is the second time I won't be coming here anymore going to Antonio's pizza,Complaint,0.96
3,Please don't go and waste your money. They should be ashamed of themselves. It's bad enough the food is overpriced but it's horrible to boot. Everything was served cold and over salted. The lobster mac and cheese was dry  their lobster tails were huge oysters from the gulf - poor quality ingredients with no taste. Go somewhere else. This place is like a dying horse. Someone needs to put it down. Restaurant smelled like an old Vegas carpet to boot. Dirty. SMH IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD. $800 wasted.,Complaint,0.99
4,I came in around 2:30pm on a Saturday and ordered the shrimp po-boy and their chargrilled oysters. The bread was stale and shrimp lacked flavor. Oysters were not great  pretty disappointing considering that's their thing. Service was very slow and the prices charged were not what was on their menu. Wouldn't recommend.,Complaint,0.97
5,"Service has gone to the bottom. This particular Chik-fil-a needs to on ""Restaurants on Edge"". I can't understand why the line is all the way in the street just to turn around and have the wrong order given to me. The last straw  for me  was not having yogurt parfaits at 8:30 in the morning. You know how your mom says if you don't have anything nice to say  don't say it?...sorry mom! Get it together! Some people actually depend on breakfast to carry them through lunch. How do you not have yogurt parfaits at 8:30? ""We were short staffed this morning."" All I could see was money being lost...where's the District Manager!!!! Help! How about bacon on my sandwich. I don't eat pork...wth? There is so much more to say...this is just MY beginning.",Complaint,0.95
6,Come eat here if you like underpaid and overworked staff with mediocre food. Foods edible and over priced; just go to Ruth Chris and get a filet or pay $40 for steak fajitas your call . Staff is miserable including the General manager. I highly suggest crab claws for your meat...welll here we are over a year later no such thing as claws just tails oh yea and after tax $4 a soda. Enjoy the friendly atmosphere. Oh yea and dont forget that service charge on to go orders; it goes to the owner and the managers get the tips for bagging it wow yet they expect the servers to take phone orders what a joke. My friend ate ceviche and literally started to turn blue and the ambulance had to take her away when the french market location was open. That says enough,Complaint,0.96
7,THEY ALWAYS GET THE ORDER WRONG!! At this point I am convinced they eat the food while cooking it. My dad ordered 15 wings and they came back with 13 wings. He also asked for large fries that he paid for and they gave him a small. Another time I ordered a cheesecake pie and it wasn't included at all in the order. This happens everytime we come to this BWW! We decided not to come back here ever again. I wouldn't recommend.,Complaint,0.98
8,Pad Thai is more like pad pudding. Noodles overcooked. Eating Thai used to be good. Now they don't care. Overpriced substandard food.,Complaint,0.94
9,It doesn't get worse than this. A $28.00 charcuterie platter that consisted of less than one ounce each if meat and cheese and just covered in al disgusting manner with stale bread and crackers. Horrible NYE celebration and the manager was obtuse. No decent cheg would have allowed that plate to leave his kitchen. We live less than a mile away and will NEVER RETURN. We encourage all Yelp users to avoid this place. If you can't get a charcuterie platter right  how bad must everything that needs to be cooked be.,Complaint,0.97
10,Ordered on Uber eats and only got part of my order. Called to say they forgot a half pound of burnt ends I was told no they combined them together. No we weighed them and it was only 8 ounces. Coleslaw had no flavor or seasoning. I was not impressed.,Complaint,0.95
11,"Went just recently on Sunday. Over rated and over priced. Had prime rib and shrimp cocktail but prime rib extremely cold and shrimp overly cooked mushy. Cannot Believe I paid all that money to get the most delicious out of all the food the Pho - hot and tasty broth even with the Ok wontons. Grand Buffet is no longer ""Grand"". Things have changed with the times. I understand due to times the price increase but quality should still be there but no longer the case.",Complaint,0.96
12,Got it on Uber eats. Forgot our drinks  food was totally bland  both the lasagne and the chicken parmigiana. Was cold   pasta was watery and the side salad was a joke.$60 + waste of money .,Complaint,0.97
13,Don't order delivery. Third time in a row they have got my order wrong. I'm not sure what is going on over there. Recently I ordered 3 different orders of wings and a burger & they sent me one order of wings in the wrong flavor & a burger with just meat and a bun.,Complaint,0.95
14,"I just paid $22 for this ""green curry with chicken"" didn't come with rice nor the vegetables described in the ad.",Complaint,0.94
15,So. I Googled best Mexican restaurants in Tucson and El Chinito Gordo came up. We looked at the menu online and thought we'd try it. Big mistake. The menu looks good and the young lady who served us was very sweet  but the food was awful. My husband had menudo and it was cold and not made with red chile sauce. The tripe was fatty  chewy and the hominy was straight out of the can uncooked. I had a chile relleno  which  was actually pretty good. However  I ordered beans and got rice. I had a Birria Gordita with it  and it was bland with very little meat. I ordered a house margarita  which was terrible. The chips and salsa were ok  we've had better. I feel bad  but this place was not good. Don't waste your money.,Complaint,0.96
16,"This bar is my usual spot with my friends but last night things took a turn for the worst. The DJ randomly said over the speaker ""there's way too many black people here!"" This stupid little bar is clearly racist and I'm disgusted. I will not be going back to that shit hole.",Complaint,0.98
17,Super disappointed I just ordered via Uber eats. It doesn't look like they added spirulina which I paid extra for and I asked for granola on the side and didn't get it which is basically my favorite part. Phone number on the receipt is invalid so can't even call to let them know.,Complaint,0.94
18,Absolutely horrible service!!!! Not rating anything you can kiss my ass! This is just to INFORM the people that this is the worst place to go too!!! please don't go here and waste your time and money. You would have to wait for an HOUR for the food. I noticed that the Dave and busters in New Orleans has a bunch of black people and I love people of all colors! But Dave and busters has the WORST STAFF/EMPLOYEES EVER,Complaint,0.97
19,I really wish I could give 0 stars. Whoever the hell Tyler is  you're a horrible shitty manager... To let me explain.. we made an order at this specific sonic location on 1/13/2022 The order contained exactly 25.09 dollars of food we ordered. (For whatever reason sonic thinks they can get away with selling shitty food for that price but my girlfriend loves it so here we are) My girlfriend asked for a #1 combo  Simple cheeseburger. No lettuce  pickle tomato  onion  We received a sandwich that wasn't even the sandwich we ordered. It was very small in size. And contained no sauce and only onion. No biggie so we called the store. Friendly little chap Tyler answered. This is about how the call went Tyler: hello this is (shitty food place) Me: hi can I please speak to the manager? Tyler: speaking Me: explains the burger problem. And not getting what I paid for cause 25$ is a lot to spend on food that isn't what you asked Tyler: it looks like you didn't ask for no onion Me: but we did? Absolute silence.... Not a single word from this guys horrible monotone voice. Tyler: is there anything else I can do for you? I just decided to hang up. Lesson learned. Fuck sonic and fuck Tyler :),Complaint,0.98
20,This establishment is violently racist. If you're African American or a person of color please spend your money somewhere else. This is not the place to be!!!,Complaint,0.97
21,"Don't book a room here!! Could not cancel a reservation because my flight was delayed in the air due to high wind and I could not use my phone because I was in the air till after midnight on the day of the reservation. The manager would not refund and was extremely rude and hung up on me because I said ""this is the way you treat your customers"" she referred to this as ""verbal abuse""",Complaint,0.96
22,This is our third time eating here. First time was really good. Had a crunchy chili relleno. Second time had the same again and it was eh ok. Last night we went and tried something different. I had the chicken fundido burrito. I asked the very nice waiter to add onions. The wife had a fajita burrito. My fundido chicken burrito had barely any flavor to it. Full of chicken with a few onions smothered in cheese and a white cheese sauce. Again with all that there was no flavor. Wife's fajita burrito was full of meat and veg but had a sweet taste to it Nothing like fajitas should taste. The waiter was a very nice young man who was very attentive. I'm doubting we will go back there again  which is sad because there aren't any good restaurants way out on this side of town.,Complaint,0.95
23,Tiffany Nathan is a skanky server here that will give her phone number to any hot guys that come in She's thirsty for cock. Tiffany Nathan loves giving her number out 813-402-6683. Call for a good time and you'll get some world famous buffalo wings to eat with the skank wad too! 813-402-6683. She loves all cock.,Complaint,0.92
24,First time at Ruth's Chris  VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Portions were very small  it was expensive  the service was slow  and the food was not as GREAT as advertised!!! Come ON!! I know things tough right now.,Complaint,0.96
25,"We walked in at 7:20  hours posted said till 8pm. They decided they were gunna close early  which is totally fine  BUT they didn't tell us when we got there. They waited till we sat down and started eating before the manager said that we needed to get out. They should've told us the minute we walked in  ""Hey we are closing early  all orders are to go only."" But they didn't and when my husband said  ""why didn't you tell us when we got in here."" The manager got really aggressive and raised his voice and said rudely  ""do you want to stay here another HOUR."" All in front of my 6 month old. All we wanted to do was finish our sandwiches. Won't be coming here again and don't recommend it. Blaze is right down the road and much better!",Complaint,0.97
26,Not good. Service was OK but the food abysmal. The best thing was the salad. Fried rice had no taste. The filet was basic. Veggies a no go. Just not good overall. Buyer beware. Pretty bad.,Complaint,0.94
27,i waited about an hour for a table when i was told the wait was 20 minutes sat down my appatizer came out with my food my shrimp was completely raw as well as my dads fish the lighting was so dim he had ate about half of his fish and when he told the waiter she said oh it's fine and laughed it off he was brought a new plate they took my whole plate which included shrimp steak mashed patatos and broccoli to the back not once but twice and then brought out the same plate they remade my shrimp it came out raw again for the second time and when i asked to speak to the manger she said she would comp my meal threw away my food and didn't ask if she could remake it when i asked her to remake my food my waiter had brought it out and said here's your lunch for tommrow and rolled her eyes mind you i was in this restaurant for about two hours and all i had so far was bread and a bite of raw shrimp,Complaint,0.98
28,If I could give a 0 I would. Don't go for lunch. It will make you sick. I've read other reviews that have said the staff doesn't pay workers fairly and I will not support a business who doesn't take care of their staff.,Complaint,0.95
29,Bait and switch. Beware. Ordered a lunch from online menu. When I picked it up prices were higher by 20%. No recourse. Unethical.,Complaint,0.94
30,Bad customer service we walked up to the register and the lady was on her phone didn't greet us we waited for her to get off her phone to help us then as I was ordering a steak the lady was very rude and talking about other customers ordering  the place is very dirty not a pleasant visit,Complaint,0.96
31,This place is DISGUSTING. Not only have they been shut down for bad health conditions and accused of treating their employees like trash and not cleaning anything. They decided to put up politics on their sign which is not good business. Very disgusting and gross. This place needs to be shut down for good.,Complaint,0.97
32,Expensive  poor service  and food not great. Our bill was over $100 for 4 people. 1 Beer and no other drinks. Only 1 chip basket per table  but we had a large party and would only give 4 baskets. Our server never filled our drinks and was charged a mandatory gratuity.,Complaint,0.98
33,I ordered a delivery order. I received my order confirmation via email. I began tracking my order and for 40 minutes my order stayed on prep. Over an hour later I received a call saying they were canceling my order because the driver left at 8 and I put my order in after 8. I will never order from this dominos again.,Complaint,0.97
34,Chicken was gross had no flavor. Rice tasted old and cold spent 50.00 what a wast of money this place is horrible,Complaint,0.96
35,Pizza and calzone just isn't very good. Whatever you do  don't go there to pick it up! I've lived in plenty of truly dangerous places in my lifetime  but I can't think any situation in which I was more certain of impending robbery  carjacking  or getting shot than waiting in that parking lot for our order to get done! Seriously!,Complaint,0.95
36,I have been a loyal customer of starbucks for a few years  and over the past year alone I visited starbucks at least 4x every week. I have always been satisfied with my order and the amount of time it took to prepare  however  I am extremely disappointed with their service in the course of the past few months. The store hours have been decimated so much that it is almost impossible to get in there once a week. I have made many phone calls asking for the new store hours but i get different answer every time. The website has not been updated and myself as well as a few others have tried to be flexible and come by when we can  but it is almost always closed. I'm not sure if this is due to short staffing or covid  but you are losing customers and money. Please take into consideration everything i have said. Thank you.,Complaint,0.94
37,Ordered three items. One showed up when driver came the first time. They offered me a 2L soda. Don't drink soda. The quality of food was not there. Horrible pizza  horrible wings  but mostly just non-existent customer service. $30. We are two wings out of each order and two slices. Had to throw everything away.,Complaint,0.93
38,We ordered take out and were told it would be 30 min. We sat and waited for an additional 30 minutes because it wasn't ready. The food is good but not worth the inconvenience and wait. Will not be returning.,Complaint,0.92
39,Horrible leadership for a small business. The management is very unprofessional. This business will never succeed with management who power trip. Team work would be more successful!!!,Complaint,0.91
40,This is the worst time I've had here. We had an 8PM reservation for 15 but was not seated until 8:30 PM. After being seated for 30 min  our drink orders were finally taken. 30 min after that appetizer orders were taken. 45 min after that entree orders were taken. We asked several times for the manager and he never came. Finally the guest of honor went to the bar where the manager was located but he was brash with her. After asking again for the manger at the table because the entree orders took an hour and a half to come out. When the manager came to the table he was brash yet again. No apology was ever offered. To his credit  Langston was doing as best he could to serve the table but he was only one person with little to no help. Every with the understanding of the impact of Covid  preparations should have been taken for a pasty of this size with advance reservations. Additionally  a simple apology from the manager instead of an unprofessional response would have gone a long way.,Complaint,0.9
41,Pretty sure I got food poisoning from expired cabbage in the chow mein 2 days ago. Should have trusted my nose.,Complaint,0.89
42,VERY racist & rude. If you're African American  do yourself a favor and go to other nearby Latino eateries. They treat other Latino and white people fine  but they appear to not welcome black people here. Marelin P is such a rude and racist cashier!!!,Complaint,0.88
43,I was looking forward to having a nice birthday dinner by treating myself to someplace better than average. I was seated right away (thanks to self seating). Someone brought water right away. The waiter took my order and brought me a drink. 45 minutes later I walked out. Having only had one soda. I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer to be followed by the Surf and Turf entree  I even upgraded to the Caesar Salad. I was going to top it of with the Crem Brulee. No food ever came to my table. No waiter approached my table again. Not even an offer to refill my drink. I was planning on leaving a decent tip on top of an expensive meal. Instead I left hungry. Worst dining experience I have ever had  not just in Reno. Do yourself a favor  go to Outback.,Complaint,0.87
44,We stayed at the hotel next door and was looking for a late night pizza place and decided to give this place a try. We had a 10 inch pizza and an order of breadsticks. The breadsticks was ok but the pizza was not very tasteful. The workers at this place were not to welcoming either and seemed like they did not want to be there. Would not recommend to anyone.,Complaint,0.86
45,They get my order wrong 90% of the time and they always seem grouchy and irritated that your making them work,Complaint,0.85
46,They gave me a 55 minute time to be ready.im fine with that. Showed up 25-30 minutes later Charged me 20% of what I ordered for a service delivery fee. I tipped as well. Got Raw uncooked pizza not the right sauces and where is the cheese on any of that. Avoid at all cost. Just now got into my raw chicken and burnt dessert. Delivery was service was fine but I would've waited another 20 minutes for the quality of food I paid for and expected.,Complaint,0.84
47,I admit that I am typically too lazy to write reviews but I had such a poor experience today that I feel an obligation to warn others. I was in the city with my daughter today  had heard this place had just opened and thought it would be a fun late and light lunch and dessert. With all patience and acknowledgment of the difficulties right now - this was still a disaster. Service was slow and inattentive. Food was not great. I had to track down our server to find our missing food. I had to remind her to clear dishes so there was sufficient room to eat our desserts. The bathroom had no toilet paper or soap. Spare yourselves and wait until this place gets its act together.,Complaint,0.83
48,20 minutes never got an order  asked for money back which took another 15 minutes. If you are hungry and actually want food to eat.... go elsewhere. The one in Carson is 30x better and you drive thru it in 5 minutes tops. Also  it smells like a clogged toilet in there.,Complaint,0.82
49,Their food is okay  but their service is so awful  slow and rude that you will never want to go back. I live nearby and have given them at least 5 chances  just not worth it  there are tons of other lovely places Old City has to offer with wonderful ownership!,Complaint,0.81
50,Wow. That was a bad chicken meal. I was the only person in the store and ordered an 8 pc dark plus fries  biscuits and mashed potatoes with gravy. After I paid I went to pick up my food. The chicken bag seemed light - after checking there was only 6 pcs. I told the worker and she gave me 2 more. I got home and discovered we received Mac n cheese instead of mashed potatoes. I hate this kind of carelessness. The fries were a soggy waste of money. I received 12 biscuits instead of 8. Thanks but no thanks. I'll go to Popeyes next time we want to splurge calories on fried chicken.,Complaint,0.8
51,Fucking disgusting I got a bean and cheese chimi and side of rice to go never again if you can't get the beans right the rest is shit stars 0.5because the $1.75can soda was good and that didn't really come from them,Complaint,0.79
52,Came in with my wife yesterday excited to check it out. We were seated immediately by the young lady hostess. As there were only one other couple in the place we figured there would be next to no wait. We were wrong. One of the owners stood 10 feet away from us talking to a couple that had finished their meal. Apparently they knew each other or their families knew each other and they enjoyed their conversations. We were completely ignored for 10 minutes. This was extremely disappointing not only because we were hungry we were truly interested in having a new pizza place to frequent. To run a business successfully as an owner you need to be responsive to your customers! Ignoring people when no one else is in your restaurant will not produce positive results and unfortunately  we will not return.,Complaint,0.78
53,I hate to give a one star review  but this Wendy's location has been pure frustration to deal with; it is open completely random hours! Until last week I've had pretty good luck with weekday lunch. I arrived at 1:00 PM to find a crane hovering over the restaurant replacing an air conditioner. And of course they were closed. Conveniently there is a McDonalds two parking lots away  so I don't go hungry  but IMO Wendy's has far fresher tasting food. And before someone comes up with a pandemic / supply chain / hiring comment  the McDonalds 500 feet away is open their posted hours every day  no excuses. C'mon Wendy's  get your act together!,Complaint,0.77
54,Closed for construction and didn't notify Yelp or google - bad business - just walked 15 minutes to get here,Complaint,0.76
55,The customer service is AWFUL! I leave in just as bad a mood as the employees. I love Cava but I think I'm gonna have to be done with this one. This time the associates were vocal they were ready to close. I got to the point where they add meat and they had ONE. They were not cooking anymore and judging by the fact the grill was cleaned way before I got there they didn't care. We weren't given an option for drinks and the card readers were broken. While eating we were all locked in with no one attending the door which is surely a fire hazard. We had to figure out how to unlock the door to get out. Maybe the Franklin location will be better.,Complaint,0.75
56,New Year's Day and weather was lousy and  as we were staying at the Dream Hotel  we availed ourselves of the on-site restaurant. Waitress was efficient and recommended the chef's special  prime rib  and served medium rare  as chef recommended. First attempt was well done  so I sent it back; second attempt was rarer but stone cold. When I pointed this out  the manager appeared and proceeded to school me on how prime rib is to be served cold. I know quite well how to cook beef medium rare and how to keep it warm and the manager's condescending manner did nothing to make the meat tasty. The side dishes were hot and delicious. My husband's prawn meal was good.,Complaint,0.74
57,We love the food but was so so disappointed last night! We chose it for dinner and they missed up our order  it was Uber delivery so it was hard to fix as it's the restaurant mistake.,Complaint,0.73
58,Stopped in for breakfast as the outside patio was completely empty. Was told it would take a little bit to find a server to work out there and take care of us. Waited for a while and then was told it would be probably 20 more minutes or longer before someone could serve us outside (another party was already seated outside too and had service). Really dumb.,Complaint,0.72
59,I came here for the comedy...and to vent a bit. If I could sit down with the owner for at least 5 mins and just hear the reason for the foolishness so it could all make sense. Honestly  I think I'm more interested with the magic of keeping a place open that makes little to no money when the employees clearly make more than what's on their paycheck. Straight,Complaint,0.71
60,Total rip off- ordered M&M cookies and they called to say they were out of those so we wanted to cancel the order- but they told us they would add M&Ms to the sugar cookies. Long story short we pick up the cookies and NO M&Ms in the cookies. I called them and the person who answered (same person that called to tell us they were out the cookies) and said whoops  we were actually out of M&Ms. I should've called you back. But of course they didn't because they didn't want to lose the sale. Well you've lost a customer. Grow up and run your business like a professional.,Complaint,0.7
61,Sat at the bar and our server was extremely flirtatious with my fiancé. I'd understand if we went to hooters or another restaurant where you go for the girls  but we did not go for the girls. she got my drink order wrong 3 times  forgot my side when our food came out  and brought him silverware but not me. super attentive to my fiancé. and he wasn't even the one that paid!!! the bar was also littered with drinks from previous guests and had definitely not been wiped down.,Complaint,0.69
62,The food used to be good.We've tried to give it few more tries  hoping it'll be at least decent tasting. This last visit was definitely the reason we won't be back. When we're seated  no one said anything. No welcome  here's the menu  waters? Nothing. 10 min later  a girl brought chips and salsa and said nothing and walked away. Another 10 min  our waiter comes up with menus  sets them down doesn't say a name and just says drinks. We didn't get a drink menu and had literally just received the regular menus. Which have changed every time we've been here. We ordered and got our food really fast. Not even 20 min. But the food orders were wrong and cold. We paid our bill and left.,Complaint,0.68
63,Waited forever  Never got our food. The manager kindly said I'll take it off the bill Well thanks since we never got it...sub par service. The couple next to us nearly walked out for same reason. Trust me  skip this place. Terrible experience all around.,Complaint,0.67
64,I ordered a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. When i got my pizza  i bit into it to realize that under the cheese on the only cheese side there was pepperoni. I do not eat meat so this was a big deal. Seemed like someone didn't realize it was half cheese and tried to cover the mistake with cheese. When we called  the manager immediately told us we ordered all pepperoni with extra cheese. I have proof this was wrong. He argued with us when i asked if it was all pepperoni why was half covered with cheese? Seems there's something wrong almost every time i order here as this is not a first.,Complaint,0.98
65,Over priced Mexican food and they make sure to purposely make your food incorrect to steal from you. My husband ordered me the pambazo with steak meat and there was no steak meat! Slow service and not a friendly place to give your business to. If you do decide to try this place make sure to unwrapped your food and make sure your food is made correctly  but if you have to go through all that trouble  then my best suggestions is to avoid this place at all cost. I would NOT RECOMMEND! there's better Mexican restaurant out here in Reno.,Complaint,0.97
66,Walked in and immediately a younger lady with glasses approached vigorously. We walked over to her and simply asked her about the packages and she had an attitude the whole time. At that point  We decided to leave. Very rude customer service. Find workers that will actually treat customers well. Do better. Dog shit,Complaint,0.96
67,i'm actually so disappointed speaking of the fact wawa never lets me down. they didn't have chicken for my quesadilla or roasted veggies and they made me pay before they wanted to tell me they had nothing i wanted and wouldn't give me a refund. get it together.,Complaint,0.95
68,"I was given an offer for a free medium 2 topping pizza from dominos but they would not let me order it because it didn't reach the ""minimum delivery price of $17"". So it's essentially an empty offer. Why even tell people that then? What the point? Just reeks of laziness.",Complaint,0.94
69,He ordered his steak medium well and it came out bloody and smelled sour.. but I loved the passive aggressive response so thank you,Complaint,0.93
70,I ordered out and was missing half my order including the 2 sauces. And the French fries were awful. They were hard and cold. After it taking them 2 hours to even get it done. As they were trying to resolve it i was on hold for 45 mins waiting for a manger  so I hung up called back because they completely forgot I was on hold. So all in all not a great experience.,Complaint,0.92
71,We have tried this restaurant three times and really wanted to like it as we live close by in Bryn Mawr. The food is average at best and the interior decor is as budget as it gets. The service at the table has always been friendly  but slow which I would actually enjoy if it were a good Italian restaurant. However  the biggest turnoff is the extremely rude (all three times now) hostess that makes you feel you need to leave immediately after eating even when the restaurant is 80% empty. I love that this location is a restaurant over the old Wells Fargo bank  but I hate to say I hope this place closes and another establishment of better quality takes its place.,Complaint,0.91
72,Garbage service  they received my order but did not follow through with making and delivering it after they confirmed the order.,Complaint,0.9
73,God this place was disgusting. The soup tasted like straight up dish soap and ruined my appetite and made me sick. Don't go here.,Complaint,0.89
74,Went here 1 hr before my flight thinking I had plenty of time. I was seated at a table and waited 20 minutes with no one coming to take my order. A family came and sat 3 tables down and got their order taken within 5 minutes and then the server walked the opposite direction from me. I went to the bar to approach the server and asked why they didn't take my order. They said my table was not assigned a server. She said she would get my order shortly. About a minute later the same host who sat me  Bryan  came and asked if I just walked in and sat myself. I responded you sat me here twenty minutes ago! About a minute later a nice server  Erika  came and took the order and got it done. I wonder how long I would have had to sit there with no response from someone because the host  Bryan  doesn't know how to do the most important part of his job...seat people. Erika  our server finally  was great. Bryan not so much.,Complaint,0.88
75,Just like Hamilton stated below...they're still on that mask mandate mess but I wouldn't even have been upset if the staff wasn't so freakin rude about it!

78,"went through  line was slow as usual but nothing crazy. our total was $10 we got a mac & cheese and a chicken sandwich. we paid and the person that took our money closed the window and left to get our food. then this girl begrudgingly open the window and told us we owed $31. i said ""no we actually just paid you're mistaken"" and she closed the window. we finally got our food  i open my LARGE mac n cheese  and it was filled  i kid you not  just above the cups half way point. i was genuinely shocked when i saw that  because to me  you wouldn't fill a large that low unless it was on purpose.. and if these employees are taking out their frustrations on the customers then this place is not going to last. i'll definitely never visit this location again. you just lost a customer popeyes. picture attached to review is right after i opened the lid. half empty. rude as hell. i'm pissed.",Complaint,0.84
79,The 5 times I have been there.... I have never seen everything available. Something is always out. One time they had no chicken. Another time no peppers. This time 2 sodas in the machine were out. The silverware was out. And every employee was chatting in back and no one was up front. No hustle or lack of care. Line is to the door. They need more staff and more product.,Complaint,0.83
80,"I went to get a vanilla cream cold brew and asked for the 20 ounce and was basically told I wasn't allowed to get it. It was under cold brew and the lady was rude to me and said ""it's a specialty drink and only comes in one size"". I pointed to where it was on the menu in the store where it is listed to come in 2 different sizes and she still refused to give me what is displayed in their store. The ounces are not an issue for me it was just the way it was handled and how it is displayed. It should be covered so that it is not confusing for the customers. I also looked in the app to see if maybe the location just had the wrong information and you are able to pick either size. Not sure what the issue is but it needed to be addressed.",Complaint,0.82
81,"The female bartender on nye underestimated us  she made my friends feel like we were below it and that we weren't worth her time.

84,We were looking for top rated Italian restaurants in the area and Alfano's was at the top. Was concerned with a number of very low ratings  and there were also good ones- so a mixed bag  but tried it last night. There was a sparse attendance; about a third of the tables were occupied. Ordered wedding soup  which was pretty good and quick. No wait for our seats  but a 40 minute wait for the two entrees - veal Milanese and chicken Marsala. Several apologies from the wait staff that they were very busy. The veal was good; the chicken tasteless and the pasta sauce tasted odd. So a very mixed meal opinion.....just like the reviews. If you go  I hope you can write a good review  but beware. One star for the meal issues vs the price.,Complaint,0.78
85,I was debating on whether to post this but here goes. My hubby I and my granddaughter went here about 5 weeks ago. We went in & it was very crowded. Lots of people sitting at the bar and we were told it would be atleast a half hour. We decided to wait and the hostess came over to tell us she had a booth  we only waited maybe 20 minutes. We walked over to the booth and as we were going to sit down this huge roach was crawling up the wall over the table. The hostess backed up and was kind of freaking. I said are you going to kill it...she backed up farther and said no way and I touching that. I took my menu and swatted it. At that point I had no idea where it was and really in disbelief that she was doing nothing about it. She just looked at us and said I guess you don't want to stay. Now I get that you are going to have some bugs but as we left I saw the hostess go into the other dining room. Maybe I should have stayed and asked to speak to the manager or owner but it was so crowded I just didn't want to be so close to all the people without masks during covid. Needless to say we won't be going back there.,Complaint,0.77
86,This is about the third time this is happened to me. I purchased the Coffee deal where I can get multiple coffees for a fixed price per month. I was using Panera as my study location as I am going to school for medical. When I get to location  the inside dining is closed and the line is wrapped around the building. If it was because of Covid  it would not be open intermittently  I was here yesterday and was able to go inside and order and sit and study  but today it is closed and earlier this week was the same situation. Very frustrating.,Complaint,0.76
87,I am truly confused as to why this establishment is so highly rated. It's as if the crowd here is not familiar with authentic poke'. We tried 'The Ring of Fire' and 'The OG'  both of which were bland with the exception of the blistered pepper. The rice was cold mush and consumed about 80% of the bowl. Please try Poke' Hana in Orlando if you would like a comparison of the night and day difference between flavorful  marinated fresh Hawaiian poke' and accompaniments.,Complaint,0.75

89,Sorry the reviews were really good so we thought we would give it a try. Sunday afternoon bad choice  we ordered 4 burgers. We waited over an hour and they were NOT amazing. They were hot but not special. Save your money  because it wasn't cheap and go to Burger Monger. Better burgers.,Complaint,0.73
90,Very unprofessional. The employee who took my order seemed annoyed the whole time and in the end got my order wrong. As well as  the environment was very negligent  so much as to the employees were wearing beanies while inside which subtracts from the overall chick-Fil-A experience. I would highly recommend the Chick-Fil-A on Franklin road instead!,Complaint,0.72
91,"Ordered take out  kind of hard to mess up. My wings were cold. And despite being freshly made.... Also how do you order the special of 10boneless wings + fries  be charged for it.

While I was waiting for my food in the takeout area a Waitress came out of the kitchen  and yelled to a table waaaaaayyy on the other side of the dine in area ""hey your food is almost done baby!"" That was super weird. my wife tried to use the bathroom  she said there was a bloody tampon on one of the 3 stalls  the 2nd stall was clogged  and the 3rd stall someone was using.

94,I would give this place a -10 if they had it. It was the worse food I have ever had. The noodles were pasty  the vegetables were cold  and the Seasame Chicken tasty like oil  no sesame flavor and the chicken tasted sour (bad). I went to complain and they refused to give me my money back and they caused a big scene. I posted on Facebook and over 50 people so far had something terrible to say about this place. Do not eat here,Complaint,0.68

We finally found a picture of a menu on yelp I believe  and then when we called to place a to go order... things got weird. I said I wanted the oatmeal parfait... she said they don't have that. I said I wanted a croissant and they said they didn't have that either. ""Maybe you're looking at the wrong menu?"". Okay  so I asked her where to find a menu and she seemed confused. She said ""I can tell you what we have  pancakes eggs bacon fruit"". Ending up ordering some stuff because at this point we were desperate to eat and we're so confused. Picked it up and they forgot a bunch of stuff and the food wasn't even good. I think we got scammed.",Complaint,0.98
98,I usually order from banana leaf 2-3x a month and Ive never had a problem until yesterday. I ordered the Indian Mee Goreng and I got food poisoning. The dish was poorly cooked and the shrimp was on the raw side and 20-30 minutes after eating  I ended up throwing up for 3 hours. I would not recommend ordering from Banana Leaf  this was a horrible experience.,Complaint,0.99
99,We booked this for NYE and it was terrible! The ship never left port and no fireworks due to foggy weather but there was never an announcement. The DJ announced midnight was approaching but never did a countdown ! Worst of all I received a response back from Jill that basically called me liar and said several announcements were made and DJ did countdown. I guess we were on two separate yachts ! She offered me $50 to compensate our $600 wasted expense. Not worth it.,Complaint,0.97

102,The only reason I am giving this place one star is due to the kindness of the staff. I have lived all over this country and have been all around the world  and this is BY FAR the WORST Americanized Chinese food I have ever put into my mouth. With that said  I am not sure who is writing these reviews giving this place over 4 stars because the food was INEDIBLE. I threw it all out without eating more than a few bites. It had almost no taste. And what taste it did have  was BAD. The General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken were bland and tasted EXACTLY the same. But the worst part was the Mongolian Beef. It tasted BAD. And when I say BAD...I mean bad like something was rotten  moldy  etc.,Complaint,0.98
103,This is one of our favorite restaurants to come to in St Pete! It legitimately is a place that we would come to if we were traveling down 75 South. Long Way in as most know. Unfortunately  they're doing you a favor basically by serving you. No thank you. Their food is absolutely incredible  but for the service itself  I wouldn't waste my time. Daytime has been a completely different experience. Daytime servers apparently care more   I guess!,Complaint,0.94
104,"Went in to place an order. No one working there was wearing a mask. Asked if the people making the food wore masks. The kid said ""yeah we have masks."" Walked out.

107,I don't normally stop into McDonald's but decided I would today to get the apps .99 cent iced coffee! I even add on a sandwich too. I did a mobile order thinking it would be faster and easier as I have work this morning. I was pulled all the way through window 3 outside. I waited for 15 minutes at this window as cars outside kept passing me. Finally someone came to the window and said her computer crashed - no biggie. Showed her my phone that I paid. Then she came back and asked me to pay more than what I was supposed to pay via the app. Then some other woman came and told me I had to pay more and that the app crashed - even though I was charged. And kept saying the man said you need to pay. So I told her to cancel my order and left. On to bigger and better things like Wendy's or Starbucks for morning coffee (: ,Complaint,0.95

110,My wife and I ate there last night! When we got there they greeted us and were very friendly. We ordered and the food arrived very quickly. I ordered a half rack of ribs and my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was cold and the meat was very dry. My ribs smelled great but that's where it ended! The ribs were cold when they arrived but I tried to eat them anyway! The ribs were extremely tough and difficult to cut apart with the plastic knife they gave us! The best part of the meal were the baked beans and the fresh cole slaw. If you eat there it is at your own risk!!,Complaint,0.96

116,"Almost everyone we encountered from the hostess to restaurant staff as well as bar staff were not wearing masks. I requested our waitress to wear a mask which she did  but it was obvious she thought i was in the wrong. Even the kitchen staff was maskless. Seriously  are you stupid or just stupid republicans? There is a pandemic and it is not over! I had read that masking was now required indoors in Pima County  and that was certainly the case at many of the places I have been to on this trip. And  I know for some this is a political issue  but dining out right now for me is a health concern  so it was bizarre to be in a restaurant and seeing most everyone unmasked  including 95% of the staff. This was a business dinner so I couldnt really back out  but if I was alone I would just flat out not eat there. To the owners of this restaurant: customers will rememebr who followed the rules and the right thing and who didnt  and vote with our pocketbooks! Oh yeah  the food was ""meh"" and dinner for two was $190 with tip.",Complaint,0.98
117,Um  if you're not white  stay away. We walked in and the old hostess rudely and nastily told us its reservations ONLY and waved us off and started to greet the people behind us--who were white of course--with courtesy and politeness. To us there was no hello  do you have a reservation  sorry but. There were people in front of us and behind us she talk to them with a completely different attitude. And yes  of course they were all white. It's a cute cute town with lots of other eating options. But if you're not white and still want to subject yourself to this treatment by eating here  then make sure that (1) you don't have an accent because she'll probably tell you that the reservation is full  and (2) make sure you use a white name. Good luck.,Complaint,0.97
118,This Taco Bell has been trash. I'm ok with the time i have to waste to get food from here. But my overall experience has been far from satisfactory! Even I though I wait longer then I think is necessary... they have never got my order right. Now I have a new problem:.. and it's the fact that they've been closing before 2. When I was told by a manager... they close at 3. My overall review of this place will be trash. . Never will I expect anything less then half ass from this low level of a Taco Bell.

119,"The WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my ENTIRE life. I came here two separate occasions  both at 7:50 pm on two separate Tuesday evenings. El Paseo advertises that they are open until 9pm  however BOTH of these times they denied me from their restaurant during their ""open hours"". The first time because they had a ""special event"" going on  which they failed to disclose on their website  and the second time  because they decided to close at 8pm that day  without any notice. The most recent time  I took a 45 minute Uber to the restaurant only to be greeted by the rudest hostess I have ever met in my entire life. She told me they decided to close early because they didn't have enough business that particular day  and after telling her I had just spent $70 ubering there and that they still had an hour and 15 minutes until closing  as mentioned on their website  she told me thats ""too bad"" and I should find somewhere else to eat  and then proceeded to slam the door in my face. I will never be returning to this restaurant EVER again  and I highly advise that you take your money and time and spend it at a small local restaurant in Downtown SB  where there is plenty of delicious food and small local businesss that actually WANT  and need  your customer service.",Complaint,0.99

157,"My partner and I love a good breakfast place- unfortunately  the roost did not quite meet our standards. We came on a Saturday morning. Restaurant wasn't busy and staffed well. When we got seated we had to wait 10 mins for a server to come and take our drink order. Then  after our drinks  they didn't stop by for another 10 mins until we made that awkward  across the restaurant  eye contact letting them know we need something. My coffee tasted burnt and they didn't have any flavored creamers (how!). My partner ordered an iced tea that was 90% water and 10% tea. It was just a mess. As for the food: very average and very ""eh."" Our bacon was alittle over cooked  my over easy egg was almost completely cooked through... the only decent item was our French toast  but even that was very average. Long story short  we most likely wont go back. There's a lot of little things with easy fixes that can be made to make this place better.",Complaint,0.96

161,Sad to leave this review  however have been giving the restaurant a number of visits with increasingly disappointing results. We also have left a few messages for Dario  who never calls 1. Today we ordered a vegetable fasilli and the chicken brick dish. Neither was very good. The pasta dish lacked flavor. There wasn't much in terms of vegetables. It was so disappointing I thought of taking a picture but it really was such a boring dish. White beans would give this some flavor and more protein. We've suggested they look at adding some beans to their vegan vegetarian dishes but have been met with radio silence 2 The chicken brick dish was not very good. Three people tried it and all were very disappointed. I'll try to add a picture of it. Very little of it was eaten. 3. The bread is an Average plus We used to go here years ago and it was pretty good. I Food today was from the Santa Barbara location on Victoria Street. We've also had disappointing meals At their montecito location. We really wish they would spend a little bit more time on their items and their ingredients especially for the pricing. Especially given they do not have good vegan options and haven't bothered to get back to us  we think we are done trying. Ciao Ca Dario,Complaint,0.97
162,The spring rolls were good  the pork baboons were good but that one piece of mini cucumber did not give the crunch factor. The pork chashu ramen was a lukewarm  tepid broth. I'm not sure what the red strands were in the broth but by golly they were bitter. I asked for spicy chili oil on the side....$1.50 extra...I didn't know I paid extra until I looked at the receipt! It's not the money but the principle,Complaint,0.91

164,Can't say I would recommend - not worth the prices. We spent $96 here for two people - that includes two meals and one appetizer  no drinks. For what we got  it was not worth it. The ambiance service and food just didn't live up to the money that can be spent elsewhere. We both did get seafood  which contributes to the price   however my meal (Picante de Camarones) was mostly rice and beans. I just can't justify spending ~$30 on mostly rice and beans ( which were nothing too special). The sauces on our meals were pretty tasty  but mine was kind of bland. My dining partner enjoyed their meal  however they also agreed they would rather have spent ~$35 elsewhere. We ordered the tamale as an appetizer and it was $13 for a single tamale- also just okay. There was only one waitress so wait times were a little long. The ambiance does not nearly make up for the prices either. Kind of tacky interior & music seemed like it was playing from someone's personal playlist. Overall  I would not recommend coming here  as you will spend a lot of money for not a lot of value.,Complaint,0.95
165,The proces were decent for how much food they gave. I ordered mapo tofu  and it just wasn't that. It was a brown sauce that was sweet - no spice at all and no option of tofu and ground pork. It was edible  but not what I wanted. They offer brown rice without upcharge which was nice. $8.45 for decent amount of general tso chicken  pork fried rice  and egg roll for dinner. Quick delivery. Just not the best I've had plus  they just don't make mapo.,Complaint,0.9
166,We used to love going and ordering steak sandwiches and a basket of fries. Now the portions are much smaller and not worth the trip. Used to order a basket of fries and would split. Now comes on a tiny plate and are told that was only size. When one of our friends ordered a sandwich and his came with fries...larger portion than when ordering JUST fries. My friends that were loyal patrons (when they fly in from LA a bunch of us would meet here) have noticed the same thing. We won't be going back...unless things go back to normal.,Complaint,0.93
167,Order was placed at 3:06P via mobile suppose to be ready at 3:12P didn't get served until 3:25P after I arrived at 3:10P waited and watched 6 people get served in front of me!!!! Called after I left talk to manger he apologized and let me know they were short staff.,Complaint,0.91
168,Less than stellar experience  service was good everything else no. Ordered farmers platter out of ribs  back up prime rib out of that as well. Opted for fried chicken specified thighs  got three pieces of 95% breading with dried out white meat sent this back next three were just as bad (18.99 to boot!). Won't be returning any time soon. Really missed the mark.,Complaint,0.94
169,The drinks were good. Bartender did his thing. Our waiter was personable and fun. But the food was lacking taste and heat. How do french fries come to the table lukewarm. My table mate said her chicken was overcooked  zapped too long in the microwave probably. My falafel was a crunchy dust ball. It was topped with what looked like ketchup. But the green salad it was on was fresh  it didn't have sauce but I guess the ketchup was the sauce. There was a side salad ordered by another table mate that was fresh. So they got the salad part right but they clearly need work in other areas.,Complaint,0.92
170,First time at JD. Ordered take out: Kung pao chicken  shrimp Lomein  firecracker chicken  fried dumplings & eggrolls. Nothing was particularly great or good. Not sure we would order again  as everything was a bit dry & over cooked. On a positive note  they are punctual. We showed up 15 minutes early  as from past experiences with take out orders  the food is usually ready before we arrive & we were trying to avoid picking up cold food. The girl that works there made it clear that she did not appreciate us arriving early... she told us very curtly  as she handed us our order 15 minutes later  we should call next time if we want to pick up early. Very odd way to interact with a customer  since we never made a fuss upon arrival and told them we were happy to wait  cuz we knew we were 15 minutes early.,Complaint,0.93
171,When did pizza become such a rip-off? For $30 I expected more than a long rectangle of chewy bread  a scant suggestion of sauce less toppings in the center  and a box with the precious Vetri name (even though he no longer owns it). The shape is for sure a clever way to increase the cheaper crust to pricier topping ratio. Really  people  buy a pizza stone and see how easy  cheap & fast it is to make excellent pizza yourself at home. You'll start calling these center city joints a rip-off too.,Complaint,0.95
172,Gave them our number. Didn't receive text. We had only ordered fries and drinks. So after 20 minutes went up to ask. Then got cold fries and Luke warm sodas.,Complaint,0.92
173,If you've been to the location in St. Pete ... keep going there; no need to try this one. Thank me later. -Bruschetta - Half soggy  half hard  bread didn't seem fresh. -Gnocchi - Better at the St. Pete location  and had quite a spice/kick to it here. *Chicken Piccata - They don't serve it at the Tampa location. *Lobster Mac - They don't serve it. May be seasonal. *Fries - Those were good. -Bread - I feel like St. Pete serves bread prior to meal. The Tampa location did not. -Blackberry Ginger Smash - It was good.,Complaint,0.9
174,Didn't care for it. Cute concept & love the name but the chicken was overly seasoned. The fries were basic as well.,Complaint,0.91
175,Chicago prices for sub par food. They start you out with some stale bread. In group of 6  Ordered 4 lackluster starters. Dry cardboard like truffle French fries  calamari that was basically just fried batter  escargot swimming in a butter bath. The pork belly that was just OK. But the waiter sure went on about how fantastic and perfect everything on the menu was. When the mains came  I found the sides to be unapealimy angus mid rare filet mignon over cooked but did have nice flavor. I should have sent it back but I was in a large party and at that point and was ready to move on with the evening.,Complaint,0.94
176,Very generic Tex-mex with very pungent garlic. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the alcohol is pretty cheap.,Complaint,0.9
177,I've come here every year for my birthday for the past 9 years. I was disappointed this year. Bring back the freshly baked bread. Pretzel bread does not taste well with oil and Parmesan cheese.,Complaint,0.92
178,I haven't eaten my food yet so I am extra bitter and maybe rambling on. I ordered chicken flautas -- noting that I wanted EXTRA guacamole. Order arrives and obviously no extra guacamole. Ugh. Sometimes folks forget. Times is hard. I forget. So I called. They proceed to tell me that the flautas don't come with guacamole. That is why they charged me for it. That I am wrong. That it isn't on the menu. Ahhhhhh. Also missing is the shredded lettuce but I don't need that. Also also didn't get the correct salsa I asked for. But none of that matters to me. Just my guacamole. Give me my guacamole  you liars.,Complaint,0.93
179,It's hard to find really tasty Chinese food. Combination fried rice  egg drop soup and low mein had zero flavor. I am giving 2 stars for the sesame chicken and chicken curry had a little more taste. The staff was super friendly but food lack spice and flavor.,Complaint,0.91
180,I've come here at least 3 times now and have always had great service and decent food. However  I came here with my friend last night and they forgot to put whiskey in her whiskey sour  my food came out 20 minutes later than my friend so they had to reheat her dish while she waited for my food to come out  and we had to flag down other employees to tend to us as our waiter did not. The trout I ordered was also over salted. The espresso martini was pretty good though. For the price and expectation of this place I expect nothing less than a stellar experience; especially service-wise. Disappointed to say the least.,Complaint,0.95
181,Disappointing...... We were excited to get a reservation on New Years Eve....even though they said sold out.....LOTS of empty tables..... 8pm......already out of their $5 Sourdough bread....so we order the flat bread....which was only a few slices....and drenched in oil....not good.... We ordered the oysters as an appetizer....the were the size of my thumb nail....and very fishy. You hate to complain  and ruin the mood on New Years Eve.....but we left very disappointed.....,Complaint,0.97
182,Let me start off with the positive open late with a limited menu. Great friendly staff location has a good beer selection. The pizza appears to be good.. then I try it .. unfortunately the flavor from piece to piece varies drastically. The first piece was hard and burned on the bottom with almost no flavor with heavy sauce at the crust  not across the whole pie. Then the second piece was better more balanced and not burned. Late night downtown Indy choices are limited. Maybe your luck would be better maybe I just got a bad pie. Hmmmmm maybe next time it will be better.,Complaint,0.93
183,We came here a couple of weeks back on a Saturday night. Rushed our dinner to get there before the 8pm closing time. At 7:45pm they were waving us off like flies saying too late the store had closed. So rude! It's Saturday night and we wanted an after dinner sweet. Will not be back. Crazy they shut so early anyway.,Complaint,0.96
184,I am sorry to share a poor review about this business but we have choices to make when we get something to eat at a restaurant. Not sure if new owners need to step up the quality but the pizza was poor at best! I hope this restaurant will improve because of it's location is convenient. Give it a try. Beware!,Complaint,0.94
185,This buffet isn't anything special. The food was subpar but the server was nice and attentive. We were surprised at the lack of offerings; pretty standard Chinese fare. For comparison  we ate at another Chinese buffet in Nampa where they have a huge spread. We found the desserts sorely lacking so we stuck with the soft serve ice cream machine. Their fruit offerings are pretty good. The chow mein was bland and the egg rolls were greasy. Lack of beef dishes as well. We were extremely surprised when we walked in that the prices were not advertised. We did our homework before we chose the restaurant and saw that on their website a weekday lunch is listed at $9.75. As soon as the server brought us or drinks she also left the check. To our dismay we were being charged $13.25 each which is the dinner price. We called the server over and asked her about the price and she said because it's a holiday. We didn't go on Thanksgiving or Easter; we went on MLK day. Totally ridiculous and price gouging! We are definitely one and done with this place!,Complaint,0.98
186,Outrageous wait times even when there are many open tables and servers. We waited in line for 30 minutes just to be told it'll be an additional 30 minutes when there was 4 servers. The same thing happened to our party on a previous day when we tried to eat here  but then we were told it would be an additional hour on top of what we had already spent in line. Just go somewhere else to eat  you'll be back in the same amount of time.,Complaint,0.95
187,The food is a no for me. Flavorless. Only up side about this place is they're open late on a weeknight and if you're starved you can get some bland food.,Complaint,0.92
188,Service was good  but food was not! I rarely write reviews  but had to share. My favorite salad is the Chicken quesadilla explosion salad. So  I know how it should look when it comes out. However  it was not recognizable and I told the server that's not what I ordered. She assured me it was  but it had very little lettuce  which was not fresh and it was already drenched with salad dressing. It was covered with sliced chicken  tons of overcooked tortilla strips and worst of all the cheese quesadilla triangles looked like they were left out overnight and place on the plate. I told the server my issues and she apologized  but I don't feel comfortable returning to this location.,Complaint,0.96
189,I expected more during our first experience at Carlucci's for dinner. Service was sub par and the indoor space is a little outdated however  comfortable. Food and drinks were OK but nothing to remember because it seemed overpriced.,Complaint,0.91
190,The Campbell location is an excellent  well-managed cafe with exceptional food and staff. We tried the Broadway location today. The food was mediocre in comparison and the service...what service? There are better places. Go to the Campbell location or try Bisquits a few doors down. Much better elsewhere.,Complaint,0.94
191,I had high hopes and ordered the Pho  but what a disappointment. It was luke warm and was basically water and noodles. I took it back and asked them for flavor and they said they forgot the broth flavoring. The staff added the broth and I added hoisin and sriracha  yet it was still terrible. A friend ordered another item and it was subpar too. Lastly  for a name like Lil Dumplings you would expect more options with dumplings. They only had three choices   but out of two.,Complaint,0.97
192,Do you like a salty Pizza? Took out two large plains...Don't know at what part of the process some genius decided to make the finished product overly salty.... but that what it is. Did they get the wrong high schooler preparing the sauce this time... I can only guess... result for my family.. high sodium pizza. imo.. not safe for older folks..,Complaint,0.93
193,It used to be good before the plannedemic 2020. Food is extra greasy now. Meat doesn't taste fresh like it used to be. Rice even tastes fake.,Complaint,0.92
194,The poor girl behind the counter has been slaving over online orders and walk-in orders for 20 minutes now. There's 4 of us in line  it shouldn't take this long. There shouldn't be just one employee handling all of this. Hire more employees and stop running out of fish (at a poke place) before 7pm. Step it up.,Complaint,0.95
195,I honestly cannot give Great Basin Brewing a good review. I wanted to like it since new ownership took over however my fish & chips & fries all were served cold  my husbands burger served cold. I informed the waitress and she microwaved my fish; It just made it soggy. The manager was kind enough to take it off my bill. I was so craving tasteful fish & chips this was definitely not the place for that. This is no Liberty on Sierra Street.,Complaint,0.96
196,It doesn't look like much when you walk by it  but when you get your food... you're right. It's nothing spectacular and they were out of a lot of things  like hash browns  spinach  and a few others. The coffee was pretty bad  but the music was the only thing that kept me from leaving. The pancakes were alright  but again  nothing special. The service was pretty slow  and usually the food makes up for it  but not in this case. The only thing that was special about this place was their band  but you can listen to them without eating there. If you do go here  if they are playing  tip the band. They deserve it!,Complaint,0.94
197,They aren't getting things right the last few times we've been there. They keep forgetting things in the bag. Another example just recently ordered egg and cheese biscuit  spicy chicken biscuit  3 hashbrowns. Got home only got two sandwiches had to run back up to get the hashbrowns got back home and wish would have opened up sandwiches cause got two reg chicken biscuits. The order on the bag had two stickers with exactly the order but none of the right food. Happening a lot there lately and super frustrating! Hashbrowns soggy and cold and one was barely filled...geesh,Complaint,0.97
198,It's a pretty location  seems inviting until you get asked by the host to be sat at the bar  there's no one in the restaurant  we sit for 10 minutes at our table and have multiple people including the bartender walk by and glance our way. Instead of asking to be sat somewhere else I see 4 servers and the host just chilling at the host stand doing nothing so we left. Food smelled great and I'm sure the drinks were good but I'd pass this location by.,Complaint,0.93
199,I do not know how this place got such. High Yelp review. The restaurant itself is super tiny and cold. It was probably warmer outside. Eating our food wasn't enjoyable just because of how cold it was. I got the brown sugar boba. I don't know if it tasted like Soap or what. It wasn't good. Definitely wasn't sweet. If you want some good brown sugar boba  go to Whale Tea. Also  the boba itself wasn't even that good. They just had it in a container. I got the garlic chicken ramen. Absolutely so flavor. The chicken pieces had no flavor. Once I added Sriracha to it  it tasted way better  but I shouldn't have to add that for it to taste good. This place looks like it should be in the food court in the mall. We know the quality there.,Complaint,0.98
200,"The pasta here is just aggressively mediocre. We were really excited because of how great the pictures were  but it genuinely was just ""ok"". Paying $18 for mediocre pasta is a huge letdown. I got the penne a la vodka  and it lacked any flavor at all. Watered down  salt less  I had to bury the dish in pepper and red pepper to taste anything at all. We also got a spaghetti  and the noodles were over cooked and the sauce tasted very odd  almost earthy? Overall  I'm really disappointed with the food. Our waitress was very kind though!",Complaint,0.95
201,I phoned the order in and was told food would be ready in 16 mins. We arrived about 20 mins later and the pizza was not even in the oven. Had to wait about another 25 mins. The wings were very good but the sauce on the pizza is a sweeter taste than we were used to but also had a spicy bite. I would not recommend this restaurant.,Complaint,0.92
202,So sad. I grew up in south STL and the Imo's out there and back then was the place to go. The pizzas  the meatball sandwich and hot roast beef..all fire. This location and overall the brand of Imo's has deteriorated so much over the years. I hate to say this  but STL Pizza and Wings is so much better and way more reasonable on price. Sorry Imo's. You're nit the same anymore.,Complaint,0.94
203,"I just stopped in to Homage for a chai latte. I haven't been there in years  but I like supporting local  and I was in the neighborhood. Sadly  it was one of the weakest chai teas I've ever had. Little flavor  no spice added  and not as hot as I would like on this chilly morning. Their pastries looked amazing  there were quite a few people seated inside  and the staff was pleasant. Disappointed with my ""spiced"" chai tea.",Complaint,0.91
204,We went to Nunzio's for a date night  but unfortunately we had to wait over an hour for our food when there were many tables still open. The food is great  but the lack of awareness from our server and the wait time for the food was not worth it.,Complaint,0.93
205,I wanted this to be a place for me to frequent like Floras down the street. Nope. It's expensive. Don't get me wrong  I will PAY for a good dinner  but I went in to get dinner and I paid $18 for a salad. It was dinner. It was $18. I expected a dinner-salad. What I got was a pre-entre salad that did not stand up to the $18 price tag. A similar salad found at Wildflower for instance is $10. And that salad  I went wow  this is good! Tucson is a City of gastronomy--https://tucson.cityofgastronomy.org/about-- so there are a lot of quality dining options out there. I don't think this place will fare well with the $$$ price tag and the lack of quantity and quality of their food. If your staying at the Doubletree  venture out  Tucson has WAY more better options. Also  had our waitress not treated us like I was bothering her during our interactions  I would have been happy to tell her my thoughts in person instead of here...,Complaint,0.96
206,We arrived before 6 on a Thursday evening and were quickly seated inside. Our meals were okay; nothing to highly recommend but big portions. However it was SO crowded and SO loud that we couldn't wait to get out of there! Not recommended,Complaint,0.92
207,Oh boy. So I paid $40 for 2 burgers an order of fries. The burgers were not special. I think I let a little tear go when I signed the check.,Complaint,0.93
208,Had high hopes  but very overpriced ramen for the quality and quantity. If I'm going to pay nearly $20 for a bowl I expect it to be top of the line and this place has dissapointed me every time :(,Complaint,0.95
209,Overall  we weren't impressed whatsoever. We placed our order online and we're hopeful for large portions given our extremely high ticket price. We got a few choices of meats and 5 different sides. The meat...pulled pork was incredibly dry. Like was this left over from the weekend? The beef brisket... it came in a round container which concerned me..when I opened it  imagine pulled pot roast. Zero smoke flavor and dry beyond our preference. My wife was looking forward to good brisket only to be very disappointed. The smoked sausage  best thing we tried but small portioned for what we were charged. The sides...oh the sides. Why is everyone afraid of seasoning? Literally where is the salt and pepper at least? Mac and cheese  boxed flavor. Green beans  bland. Slaw  blah. Baked beans  tasted like beans with a bottle of bbq sauce squeezed into them. Brunswick stew was like eating leftover stew that someone tried to spice up with more bbq sauce. Will we be back? Maybe. Recommend to friends  no. Worth the price you pay  absolutely not.,Complaint,0.98
210,Confusing menu  food isn't much to write home about. I've had a lot of sushi but would rate this sushi as disappointing. It's not bad by any means  just not worth your time when there are better options nearby. The portions were generous  however.,Complaint,0.95
211,Three years after my earlier review  and nothing seems to have improved. This time I skipped the 'meat and three'  and decided to see how they would do with that 'All-American' favorite  the cheeseburger and fries. First  the good part. The french fries  even though they were obviously previously frozen  were excellent. They were served hot  slightly crisp on the outside  perfectly done on the inside. But the sad part was that the burger wasn't as good as any you could get at the fast food joints just off the Interstate. Disecting it  patty looked fresh  but was completely devoid of flavor. Apparently they didn't even have salt or pepper. One last comment: the coffee was just dreadful. It tasted like they used whatever they could get at the lowest possible price. C'mon folks. At least try to get the coffee right.,Complaint,0.97
212,I understand making mistakes with a sandwich but I would bet money that both employees were high as a kite when my daughter and I came in today. Ingredients were added to a sandwich that were never mentioned  others that were requested were left off completely  and I've never seen someone make a sandwich so slowly. Don't go to work high  kids. Customers can definitely tell even if you think they can't.,Complaint,0.96
213,Did the 'when in Philly  get a Philly cheesesteak' thing. Hate to say it  don't love Genos. First time I had a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead of shredded. Also the last time I will have a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead to shredded. What an odd concept. I will say the employees were kind and extremely fast at getting the food out so kudos to them. The cheesesteak was so basic. Just a slice of cheese  thick slices of tomatoes  a ton of onions  and let's hear it  sliced meat. Wish it was more cut up and mixed around and blended together but I suppose when you are Genos  quantity is more important than quality.,Complaint,0.94
214,Cute atmosphere  food is not very good. Idk why this place has so many stars. Salad was SO over dressed I couldn't even eat any of it. Chicken is that disgusting chewy chicken you dread getting served. Skip,Complaint,0.96
215,I want to like this place... But the service and staff just kind of suck... Honestly they could seem to care less on the product they put out... I don't think I've had a hot taco yet... Which is sad because I think of many of them could be better if they were served fresher and with a little care... honestly Del taco and Taco Bell serve warmer fresher and better put together tacos and we've all seen what they look like...The beans with the green stuff in them I don't know what that is but it's not Mexican food... Not even edible to me Imho,Complaint,0.95
216,Came early on New Years Eve. Waitress was fantastic. Food was pretty subpar. For some reason the hostess felt the need to correct my husband of 36 years on who should go first. Crazy,Complaint,0.92
217,Live music was great. That's all I can say because I sat here for an hour without being helped. Finally caved and got a drink from the bar. Came for the 'free sunset shooter' that never happened.,Complaint,0.93
218,Usually always happy with the seafood trio. This time not so much. Very skimpy on the seafood  barely a octopus leg if reconstructed. A few shrimps and a few scallops. Very sad. They piled in the sides to fill the plate. I understand prices have gone up but this was very disappointing.,Complaint,0.94
219,I'm really disappointed in Shokku Ramen. When a ramen place opened up so near my home AND they promised to have Miracle Noodles on the menu (I would have been fine with any gluten-free noodle but I was especially excited to try those)  I was so thrilled. I went one time early last summer (before I became more seriously gluten free out of medical necessity) and was told after an incredibly long wait that they were 'working on their staffing issues' and that they would have the noodles 'soon.' It's been over six months  yet the company is still saying the same thing about staff and the noodles have been taken off the menu altogether for a few months now. Thoroughly annoyed with their lack of inclination to make actual changes... especially in a neighborhood like Hillsboro Village. What a letdown.,Complaint,0.96
220,Let me start by saying Central Taco & Tequila is a nice  stylish  well lit and clean restaurant with a very nice staff. If you're looking for Mexican-ish or Mexican-style food then you will LOVE this establishment. However  my girlfriend and I were under the impression that we would be eating actual Mexican food and that was were things fell apart. Putting beans  rice and meat in a tortilla may add up to 'Mexican food' on paper  but I can say with absolute certainty that there is not one Mexican chef  owner or other employee that is involved with making this food. Eating here is like doing Taco Tuesday over your white best friends parents house in middle school. I'm quite confident our burritos were from an El Paso kit found in the 'ethnic aisle' at Shop Rite. The guacamole tasted like it was squeezed from a plastic package. If it were made on the premises I'm not sure if that would be better or worse. It just had no flavor and no soul. If you're dropping in for a drink on happy hour  they have some nice beers and tequila flights  but if you want Mexican food  an assembly line Chipotle burrito feels infinitely more autenticó. If for strange reason the Cartel came to Haddon Township and had to eat this food  they would almost certainly dismember anyone involved with making it. Two stars.,Complaint,0.97
221,We were not pleased at all. The biscuits were small and hard. The glaze was ok  but where was the cinnamon? I especially wanted to try them because I heard good things. When my hubby walked in to pick up our order  ( I had called ahead!) they weren't ready and the young man just grabbed them  poured the glaze over them and that was that! It was 90 min before closing time  but they were in a rush to close! Not sure if we'll try them again!,Complaint,0.95
222,We have been to Sunset Sushi on numerous occasions. Normally the food and service is good. The past two occasions were terrible. Tonight we arrived at 5:15 and were the first people seated. We promptly ordered. It took over a hour to get our food. We saw other people get up and leave. At a minimum the management should have taken something off the bill. Will not be back.,Complaint,0.96
223,Interestingly we've been here a few times  normally one of our stops for dinner while in town  however  this time was absolutely not great. Bland over cooked food  poor service  and sub par in general  not a good look for the most expensive steak house open with expectations of such. When the waiter clears you plate still full of food and fails to even ask if everything was ok  tells me they don't care. This will more than likely be my last visit to Luckys  there are just too many restaurants that are doing good things to pay supremely overpriced fares for lackluster food,Complaint,0.97
224,I was so excited to try this place in Reading Terminal as I had heard rave reviews and saw the line wrapping around the shop. Sadly the food did not live up to the hype. I got the classic roast pork sandwich they are known for. The pork itself was dry and not juicy enough  The broccoli rabe added a slight mustardy taste that did not complement the rest of the sandwich. Overall  it was just an okay sandwich. I found it quite bland and it definitely could've used more sauce or something to add flavor.,Complaint,0.94
225,I won't name the server by name but he needs more training! He was nice but NEEDS more training! Place wasn't even half full. 8pm. He had 2 tables. 3 total people to help. I asked for water 3x. Asked for green tea. Never got it. Never got water either. Got the water from someone else. 20 mins later he asks if he can get me anything else. I say some water please! Told him he forgot the tea. He was nice about it but left it on the bill. He took it off. Left me with no pen for 10 more mins. Ugh!!! Train him! You pay for the food AND the experience. Make it better. --Sushi was good. Calamari was way different than in the menu. (See photos),Complaint,0.95
226,Food is ok but has no spice or real flavor. It is obviously catering to a specific type of white person that lives in this area. Bland flavorless food with mediocre service. Depending on the day you will find the staff less than friendly. We all have bad days but it seems they're just bitchy a lot. Definitely don't consider this Mexican food but more of a white man's TexMex.,Complaint,0.94
227,The location is great. The build is new and nice. The signage is eye catching and bring people in. The decor is typical. The photos of the family traveling is a neat idea. The menu has a good variety. Food is definitely Americanized. The food is just average. The chips and salsa are extra and the guacamole seemed a little over priced but I'm not sure how much avocados cost in Idaho. The actual meals were just okay. I have eaten here twice now and not impressed. The kitchen sink burrito was not good. Unfortunately it tasted just like it's name. Sounds mean but my 13 year old cooks better than that. It was busy on the inside and was difficult to find a table. There was a super large group that had no common courtesy and acted like they were the only people in the world. They had already finished and were just hanging out and talking. They had no responsibility for their kids and they were running around inside like it was a playground. This part was not really in control of the business but they could have maybe mentioned for them to leave when completing their meal so others who had ordered could sit down and enjoy their meal. And to not let their kids run around bothering others. I have a family four kids but would never let them be disrespectful to others and behave in such a manner.,Complaint,0.93
228,The place went completely downhill after Covid. The ingredients are not the same. They no longer have the Red Fish. The menu doesn't have much on it as they use to. I won't be going here anymore,Complaint,0.96
229,Visiting from out of the area. Soup du jour was cauliflower scallop. Delicious! Except there was no detectable cauliflower. Tasted like cream of mushroom with some scallops thrown in. Entree was medallions of veal with potatoes Anna. Veg was a mixture of tomatoes  mushrooms & kale. Veal was poorly trimmed...raggedy hunk hanging off one  fat blob on another. And  sadly  overcooked and a bit tough. The potatoes & veg were poorly seasoned. No detectable salt in one bite  overwhelming amounts in the next. The potatoes were dry as a bone. Dessert was the Grand Mariner soufflé. Beautifully baked and looked wonderful. Horribly sweet and a total miss. Wouldn't recommend and would never go back. Service wasn't great either. Very long waits  no offer of coffee or a second glass of wine and we had to push our dishes across the table to hint they they needed picking up.,Complaint,0.97
230,I wanted to like this place. I was following them for a long time on instagram and finally had time to go in. I thought the ambiance was alright. Very tight space and does need a deep clean. The food was very mid. Too much frozen stuff for me.,Complaint,0.92
231,We ordered food for delivery. It took 2-1/2 hours to get delivered. I've ordered from here for the past 6 years. Not even a phone to let me know what's going on. I even called and she said they were backed up. I asked if my order had even been out for delivery yet. This 1-1/2 after my order. She said she didn't know.,Complaint,0.95
232,ordered pick up with door dash my gravy was liquid not thick at all. The rest of the food does look good though.,Complaint,0.91
233,You guys got rid of a lot of great things on the menu. I was very disappointed when I could not order the beef stroganoff or even pizza. Only ordered drinks and then left. This used to be a go to place but not anymore.,Complaint,0.94
234,Service was great  but the food was meh. I ordered the Western omelette and the onion and peppers were kind of raw. The pancakes my partner ordered upset both of our stomachs (either that or it was the water). Utensils were also a little dirty. Standard diner with room for improvement. The server was wearing a face mask the entire time  and the booths are distanced/separated  which we appreciated,Complaint,0.93
235,We select Pearl based on a local. Allowing for slower service  most restaurants are short staffed  we still found service lacking. Apps came with no one to check on us  and we ordered salads with dressing on the side  not an unreasonable request for an upscale restaurant.- Salad came drenched in dressing and two upcharge Caesar's came with tired brown lettuce (sent back). The fish special was OK  but a very small portion and at $52.00 disappointing. My daughter ordered seafood pasta which had a decidedly strong unpleasant aroma  not sure if was the spice or fish. Overall dinner for four with 2 glasses of wine was about $300.... we are not going back.,Complaint,0.98
236,Placed our order through Grubhub at 6 pm on a Friday for 1 pasta dish and 1 pizza. Estimated 45-50 min wait time. After 45 mins  got a notice that they accidentally gave our order to someone else. Mistakes happen. But it took another 50 minutes for them to remake and deliver our order. Disappointing that we didn't get our order prioritized (shouldn't take 50 mins to make 1 pizza and 1 pasta dish and deliver it 7 minutes away). When I called to ask about the long wait and check on my order (1.5 hours after I placed my order)  I was told they only had 2 hostesses instead of 3 working that night. While it did sound busy in the restaurant  it shouldn't take 3 hostesses to ensure the right orders are picked up  nor do hostesses make the actual food or prioritize the orders. When then food did arrive  the pizza was cold and lacking in flavor. The pasta was warm but also lacking in overall flavor. Order local (Bar Sera  Bar Luca  Pepperoncini's in Conshy or Pietro's in Radnor) for better service and quality. Management needs to step up the game if they want their chain to compete with other options in the area with food that is as good or better and with better service. This could be the outlier but we won't be ordering again.,Complaint,0.97
237,Ok  so I only way the ravioli sometimes I get some fries Now there's this new thing you can only order online   here's the thing ONLINE YOU MUST SIGN INTO TO SOME ACCOUNTS  and everything you want is NOT even there to order .. for example (plain fries/ small salad/house salad).. it's realllll hard to give my money to them at this point .. and you can just give up trying to get someone on the phone because that's not going to happen .. whoever's idea this only online thingy was must not have been thinking AT ALL that day ..,Complaint,0.96
238,"I don't hate it here  but I definitely don't love it. Came in on a Friday lunch and the place was dead. Took about 20 minutes just to get some rum drink with an extra ""floater"" that tasted like straight cranberry juice and sugar. Opted to get a beer flight after 2 sips of my drink. Beer flight was good  okay selection of beers. We ordered a crab rangoon dip as an appetizer and felt like we were just eating warmed cream cheese - NOTHING close to those delicious pockets of crabby goodness you'd normally get! The 2 things this place has going for it are the open air concept on both floors and their lobster roll. Lobster was fresh and plentiful on the roll. Good taste and perfect size!",Complaint,0.94
239,When you order pad Thai  you might expect a peanut sauce and that traditional dish you get from a Thai restaurant  but that's not what Thai Kitchen will serve you. It's a bit more of a sweet teriyaki thing. Pretty over seasoned so by the time you get to the bottom  it's a little much. Kind of gut bomb-y. Can't say I'd go back  but I think the college crowd loves it.,Complaint,0.95
240,Currently sitting in the drive thru...24 minutes the longest wait ever! The van in front of us took up 15 minutes ordering  meanwhile in the right lane 4 cars already went thru. The difference between this visit and others  there is no one out there taking orders. Never again.,Complaint,0.99
241,"Located at the end of B Terminal  social distancing seems to be a thing of the past  all customers shoved on one side of the restaurant. Only breakfast at 10:30a. Bland shrimp and grits. Wait staff seems bored and unfamiliar with ""If you can lean  you can clean"". But you are trapped. Metaphorically.",Complaint,0.96
242,I'll be honest  I'm not a fan of the chain. There's better local options here in Nashville. I haven't been to a PF Chang's in easily a decade but we met another couple here at their request to have dinner. The Mu Shoo Chicken is no longer in the menu which is what I ordered so I opted for the pad Thai chicken and was left disappointed as there was zero flavor to it. Go to Deg Thai or Smiling Elephant or Soy Bistro if you want actually great food cooked well with flavor and seasoned. The wait was long even with a reservation  as we got seated a half hour after our call ahead time and the service was okay at best. Next time we'll recommend going to our local faves when meeting these friends rather than waste our time and money with lackluster food.,Complaint,0.97
243,"On my quest to find a good liver dish with nice wine in Philly  I ventured to Jake's. Upon entering  I was calmed by the dim(ish) lights  warm colored walls  and low music. A relaxed but semi-fancy atmosphere  depending on where you'd sit. The Boudreaux wine we ordered was quite delectable- dry  not too sweet  and a woodsy aftertaste- however  that was the end of my meal's delight. The ""calve"" (it's calf!) liver I ordered medium was well-done with no pink  and was served atop an apple potato salad you would get made by your aunt that can't cook at a family picnic. I get they were trying to be clever - liver and ""caramelized"" onions (which had 0 flavor  barely cooked  and caramelized onions are usually my favorite salty topping to ANY savory dish) with apple - but the flavors mixed together sabotaged each other. On their own  each was not too shabby. Additionally  the portobello mushroom soup was nothing to call home about - it reminded me of the Campell's can of cream of mushroom soup your parents would force you to eat as a kid. My boyfriend's slow-cooked pork was the best (and only) amazing item I tried that night- for the prices (30$ for a sub-par liver and the equivalent of one small white potato) I think this place is overrated  and would call this diner quality food (no offense to diners) at a romantic atmosphere restaurant.",Complaint,0.98
244,It was okay. We made a reservation for a Monday which was totally unnecessary but it is what it is. The menu online did not reflect the menu in the restaurant but we were fine with that. We decided to get fried alligator as an app (free with a Yelp check-in!) and it was super chewy with too much breading. For my entree I had the crawfish pasta. The entree was very good but could have used more crawfish. Our drinks were very weak. Our waiter was disengaged. The manager who helped with the free app was nice. The hostess wanted to be anywhere but there. Still giving three stars because it's still a pandemic yada yada.,Complaint,0.93
245,"After visiting a handful of times over the past year or so I would put edison at 3.5 stars (rounding down to 3 due to the pricing). The service is consistently very good and the creativity is commendable but something about the food always leaves me wanting. I read the menu and am always intrigued and excited by the combinations but then the food comes and it feels like something is missing. After the 20+ dishes I have tried I can say that nothing has ever been ""bad"" (no small feat given some of the combinations they pull off)  but also nothing has ever been DELICIOUS. At the end of the day the day the dishes are more memorable on the page than on the palate. Will be interesting to see what Michelin makes of edison later this year. Lastly  I'll say that the price increases are obscene. Some dishes have nearly doubled in price since our first visit. The food is simply not good enough  nor generous enough to justify the current price. After our most recent visit  our group went for burgers given we were still hungry and not willing to spend $100 per person at dinner. I'm sympathetic to food costs  supply chain  labor costs etc. however we regularly eat out at other leading restaurants in the area and have not had this experience anywhere else. I hope they can figure out their sourcing.",Complaint,0.96
246,I always enjoy the food  but every time I go to get food the guy behind the counter never responds or communicates and just walks away. You don't see him again until he brings you your food. Even when ordering to go  it'd be nice to know if it's going to be a few more minutes before it's ready  rather than retreating to the kitchen without any info. It's a small thing that makes a BIG difference.,Complaint,0.95
247,The salads are excellent crisp and large. The pizza however is always undercooked and soggy at the center. The toppings are incredibly abundant a result of too much sauce and if ordering anything with vegetable topping the same issue is even worse. Be prepared to pop the pizza on to your own preheated oven pizza stone and bake a bit more which helps. Or perhaps recook each slice in a non stick pan. Regrettably this is the problem which is a shame. Never ordered anything else beyond salad and pizza. In person service is hyper to order and takes a normal time to bring out. The and the staff are loud and live in their own world with annoying music and shenanigans. They are oblivious to how weird they come across.,Complaint,0.97
248,Run of the mill diner. Nice place to stop by for a late-night dinner as it is open 24 hours. The food is just okay  but that is to be expected. Our waitress was nice.,Neutral,0.85
249,DELICIOUS FOOD!!! It's a Tucson Gem. Truly one of the last few great spots to get authentic food. I like the sushi however I sat at the bar once (I've been going here for years) and I really lost my appetite after seeing the way the sushi chefs were not sanitary at all. I also noticed one of the sushi chefs go to the bathroom with his gloves on and walked out with them on and still went straight back to work. I was in shock and ended up ordering Ramen instead. The SERVICE though is truly wonderful. The ladies who are waitresses are fantastic.,Complaint,0.94
250,From the music to the Aloha greetings when you walk in  they really attempt to give you a Hawaiian vibe in the restaurant and I'll give them credit for that. Unfortunately  the sushi isn't that great. I've lived in Hawaii so I know good fish and this just isn't it. I don't even think it's as good as some that I've had on the mainland. It's worth a try  but don't be surprised if you're disappointed.,Complaint,0.95
251,Let me start by saying that everyone from the hostess to the waiter were amazing  I just wish the food was as great as the staff. The Gumbo was lacking in substance and flavor. The jambalaya was could and the rice was over cooked and mushy. The Red Beans were Amazing! The cocktail was fun but weak.,Complaint,0.94
252,Very friendly service  but took quite a while for the food to come out. Food was ok (chile relleno). The ice tea was bad. The water used had a bad flavor and overpowered the tea. Small setting and the couple next to us didn't know a vocabulary beyond the f word. Not the restaurant's fault  but certainly interfered with our meal. Not sure I'll return.,Complaint,0.92
253,The food and service on New Year's Eve was excellent. That said  we paid much more than we expected to pay for dinner  partially because we didn't get a text telling us about the special menu and $124 per person for New Year's Eve because my husband's cell phone had been stolen. I did receive a reminder email from Yelp on 12/29 but it reinforced the $49 meal price. Since the price included wine pairings  it wasn't unreasonable. But my husband doesn't like wine so we probably would have cancelled had we known. While the problem with the text wasn't the restaurant's fault  I do have an issue with the 20 percent ($50) Fourking Fee we were charged on top of the 20 percent tip. There was no mention of this extra fee anywhere I can find in the text or on the website. All-in-all  two dinners with wine and a beer cost $379.,Complaint,0.96
254,Our food order was deserving of five stars. My husband ordered the Pad Thai (his favorite) and I had the chicken fried rice. Both were served piping hot and full of flavor. Our service though was INTENSE. Our waitress had zero patience as we placed our order  although we knew what we wanted to order she was walking away as we were still explaining the specifics of our order. She did this again when we had a request for condiments. She wouldn't slow down long enough to listen to us and by the time she returned with what we needed  we were finished eating and looking for our bill. This is truly one of our favorite places to eat  I just hope we never get this server again.,Complaint,0.93
255,Drink selection here is probably a 4/5 but so/so quality bar food with an exceptionally long wait every time I'm here lately. The turnaround times for entrees is also insanely long and on more than one occasion I've had subpar attitudes from waiters here. The beer variety is their truly redeeming quality and they do a good job sourcing from local brewers!,Complaint,0.91
256,The bar is Christmas themed. I got the Grinch shot and another drink in a Santa boot. Paid about 35-40 bucks for both and that's including the tip I added for the bartender. Both drinks were very sweet not enough to get you tipsy. If you're looking for a fun place to meet your friends to start the night Tinsel is it. The staff was friendly and the holiday chair was the perfect instagram photo spot. If you're worried about Covid no one wears masks inside. It's very crowded on the weekend and they do check to confirm everyone has been vaccinated. Better late than never but happy holidays.,Neutral,0.85
257,I heard about this historic place that you HAVE to eat at if you visit New Orleans  so we came. The atmosphere and nostalgia behind this place is what earned it the 3 stars. The food was nothing special or anything that made the hype worth it. It's your average southern food joint. I was prepared to have my eyes rolling in the back of head after the first bite  but that wasn't the case. By no means was it nasty  it just wasn't delicious. If you're going to visit  do so  but don't be expect to have your taste buds blown away.,Complaint,0.95
258,"We came in for dinner during a snow storm and when we were there we saw a fun band play some bluegrass music and they were very good. The restaurant got very busy once the band started playing and the place is small so it was a bit loud. We ordered the sweet potato hush puppies  which were pretty good  and we had the half chicken and burger for dinner. The chicken was good but it came with croutons and cold tomatoes for the ""vegetable"" so we had to order another item due to the plate being quite small. The chicken was good but it was a little expensive for what we got.",Complaint,0.92
259,Started price gouging! I've been eating here for at least a decade. Prices have always been fair and Gyros are great. Inflation sucks and is a part of life in 2022...but Gyroshack got greedy. 36% increase. Sorry  you'll need to resolve your business model as I'm not paying $8 for a Gyro...no other fast food has gone up 36%  you're being greedy. Ironically as other reviews have mentioned  they don't even pay their employees enough ($7.50) to eat at their own restaurant! When you're driving slave labor and implementing massive price increases you know this establishment has jumped the shark. Interesting to hear they have fairly new ownership...go figure.,Complaint,0.98
260,This was more like 2.5 stars but I rounded up for the fries. I saw this on Uber Eats and this is right around where we live so I thought I would give it a try. Ordered the Philly cheesesteak for my husband and I got the Dagwood. The wheat bread was over toasted and dried out. Meat was not a substantial enough amount. Condiments and toppings were actually good and fresh. The fact that they have fresh cut fries was nice because sometimes you just don't want chips. Probably wouldn't go back.,Complaint,0.96
261,First time and was excited to try THE CAFE DU MONDE beignets. However  when we arrived the line wrapped around. We had to wait 30+ minutes in the cold before we can place our order. Keep in mind that this location accepts cash only. The tables and chairs are not really cleaned throughout after people leave so beware. We order one order of the beignets which comes with 3 pieces. When we open the bag  the beignets looks disappointing and not the puffy cloud beignets it was supposed to be. It looks just like random blobs. However  it taste amazing! Please keep in mind that there are many locations of Cafe Du Monde in NOLA so I would recommend checking the other locations if you don't mind not going to the original location.,Complaint,0.93
262,Went one night for a quick bite and drinks! Wings were amazing! Like really good. Also for a burger off HH menu. Was supposed to come with lettuce and tomato and had no tomato. Asked to be cooked medium and came out Med well to well done. All in all...go for the wings.,Complaint,0.91
263,Came on a weekday for lunch around 11:30AM  not too crowded  private parking lot in the back  has outdoor seating. Got the Tuck Special  didn't realize it didn't come with sides and is a sandwich. Flavor was quite delicious from the pimento cheese and sauce  but the brisket wasn't anything special. It was a bit hard and not flavorful at all  and I added a bunch of the BBQ sauce on the table to it. Mac and cheese was a bit sweet or something  somewhat odd. Really liked the grits though!,Complaint,0.88
264,Kind of a major tourist trap here but you gotta have a cheesesteak when in Philly. Located near the Ben Franklin museum  this was very quick and easy after a long morning of museums. Lots of options on the cheese so take a step back and really take a look at the menu. Ordering felt a little rushed. We had the classic cheesesteak. Wished we mixed it up a little. The fries were fresh. If I could have just had a beer with it  it would have been perfect!,Neutral,0.87
265,We sat outdoors  and I have to say  the setting is wonderful. Right in the middle of all the action  with the glorious St. Pete waterfront right across the way. Our server Chase was charming and attentive. The smoked salmon sandwich was out of this world. But the shrimp po'boy was such a disappointment. It's not a po'boy if it is not on a French roll  and this was on a ciabatta roll and a stale one at that. Inexcusable. We travel all over the country and it really is hard to find a great mid-priced restaurant. I had high hopes for this place but no  it fell short. We had to wait 20 or 30 min for a table and we saw several empty  unbussed tables. It was okay  we walked around the park in the sunshine and with every business short-handed these days I really can't hold that against them.,Complaint,0.94
266,Ok disclaimer that this review may be unpopular but it is my opinion only. We were staying in the area and had heard about this bakery which was known for some great breakfast sandwich items so we stopped by. We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the crispy chicken sandwich. Breakfast sandwich: 3/5 Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more. Chicken sandwich: 4/5 After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side. I wish the bacon pieces were thinner and crispier.,Suggestion,0.9
267,Love me some Oscar's. But  if you're going to offer breakfast burritos in the menu  maybe be open during breakfast hours?,Suggestion,0.92
268,The food and drinks here are solid  but the wait time for food was obscene. Our reservation was on a Friday night at 7:15pm. The appetizers and drinks came out reasonably quickly  but did not get our entrees until closer to 9:30pm  maybe an hour and a half after appetizers came.,Complaint,0.96
269,I'm torn on this place - we were really hoping for a great experience. Our waiter was wonderful. Very attentive and one of the only reasons we would give another try. Steak was very very underwhelming and not cooked to the right temperature. Fish dish was just meh. The bill was crazy expensive for such subpar food  but I just can't help thinking we should try just one more time. First experience definitely missed the mark on the food.,Complaint,0.95
270,The food was good and the service was adequate if not slow. The Prosecco  beet and citrus terrine  and crème brûlée was great and we should have stopped there. We spent more time waiting for food  to take orders  and the bill than we did eating and drinking. When a plate of food is served  the protein should face the diner so they don't have to use their napkin to turn around a screaming hot plate in order to eat their food. We ordered Prosecco and the menu (with wine list) was taken. We eventually asked another waiter for a wine list and apparently the fact it was on the table again wasn't hint enough. But then we never saw our waiter again before another server delivered the food. Apparently wine was not an option for us. Hint: we wanted wine. Did I not realize it's a self serve joint? We were seated immediately next to the entrance of the outdoor seating area (very nice)  where apparently 3-4 servers decide to hang out while while waiting for something to do. While all seemed very nice  not exactly great ambiance compared to others who were seated further down  and frankly  seemed to get more attention. Three scallops  mashed potato's and asparagus for $45 seems a bit overpriced even in this area and at that service level is a really disappointing. We finally asked for the bill so we could get up and leave.,Complaint,0.97
271,The restaurant has a nice atmosphere  nice & fancy set up. Parking is ok  the area gets crowded but if you're patient you'll get a parking space. Service was decent  despite us being place way back of the restaurant. Everyone but me enjoyed their food. I'm not sure I'll be back.,Neutral,0.85

273,Well gotta say this was my first trip in and I wasn't overly thrilled I ordered a large burrito the pork verde one while it was big and hot there wasn't much meat in it the flavor of the meat was also bland it was nearly all rice past that I'd give it maybe 4 out of 10. Service was quick though...,Complaint,0.93
274,Ate here about a week ago. Our server was great and very attentive. My hubby and I ordered the beef fajitas. I only got 3 small one inch pieces of lettuce and small amount of pico. The guac was fantastic as it has been in prior visits. The steak was cooked well  but over seasoned. Limited menu compared to the past and beer selections very limited.,Complaint,0.91
275,We happened upon Blanco Cocina + Cantina on December 30th 2021... and I'm so glad we did. We were in town to watch our Purdue Boilermakers take on the Tennessee Volunteers in the Music City Bowl. It was a beautiful day  and we needed to fuel-up before the big game. This attractive restaurant is right on Broadway. I would not call this an authentic Mexican restaurant; but rather an upscale  Americanized  Mexican restaurant. Our waiter was very nice  and hustled his butt off. He mentioned they are known for their Short Rib Machaca meat. I ordered The Tucson Chimichanga with ... (you guessed it) Short Rib Machaca. It had good flavor but the meat was a little too mushy. It came with rice and beans. I loved the rice! My wife had The Little Gem Caesar salad with steak. It was tasty. This is a solid restaurant. I'm not sure when I'll be in Nashville again  but I'll definitely keep this place in mind!,Neutral,0.87
276,The food here is good  but the guy who is usually here running the register is not friendly and to be honest  it limits my ability to enjoy the food. Recently  for several months a friendly woman ran the register and my wife and I began to frequent this establishment more often. Today we discovered that the guy is back.... So likely we will decrease our visits again as a result. Maybe we will just do a drive by to see who is running the register. Maybe we will just go elsewhere.,Complaint,0.94
277,Food was good  but bar service/takeout process needs improvement. The kitchen was pounding orders out and I saw bags & boxes sitting without being delivered for take outs. The gentleman next to me goes 4 nights a week and wasn't even offered water while he sat at the bar waiting to be served; he left and I waited 45 min for my order which was cold by the time I got home. Was disappointing. In their defense  it was a wicked busy night  and  I only went once. There were a bunch of regulars which speaks loudly to their core customers devotion to restaurant.,Complaint,0.92
278,3.5/5 This was our first time ordering and unfortunately we weren't blown away like the other reviews said we would be. I got the besties 2: chicken and pork with Mac n cheese Hubs got the pulled pork sandwich with beans. We both agreed the best part of the meal was the bbq sauces! That bestie sauce I don't regret trying this while in town  but we preferred pappy's.,Complaint,0.9
279,Have been there before & really enjoyed it  but this time the sauce was tasty on the boil but almost completely oil! Also there was a lot of in the shell crawdads. They only have a bite of meat in the tail. Not a very good value for the price. We ordered the Black Pearl. Also  even though we had 4 adults and a 2yo with an 11 yo  only the 4 adults ordered food and the kids ordered drinks  we were automatically billed an 18% tip so our bill came to approx. $228.00. An expensive lunch!,Complaint,0.96

283,This used to be a pizza place I can count on for whenever I crave for pizza. Sadly this time my experience was subpar.

284,Let's get right to the point: this place is an ugly twin of Panda Express; it's identical with pricing and food options  but the quality is slightly lower. I think Panda Express is God's gift to mankind  so I thought this place was average. However  I realize any normal person would have probably throw up  and so I am reluctant to give 3 stars  but it's because there can be only one greasy-unauthentic-Asian-running-to-the-bathroom establishment  and that's Panda Express.,Complaint,0.92

286,L O C A T I O N ! On recommendation from my daughter who had visited Clearwater Beach  and an old high school friend who lives nearby  we had lunch here. On vacation Minnesota  any seafood was appealing! Crab & Shrimp Chowder. 4 stars Grouper Cheeks. 4 stars Chicken Nachos. 3 stars The Grouper Cheeks were SO DELICIOUS  but I ate too many. Tummy ache  my bad. Chowder  very Floridian. Nachos  near impossible to get from plate to mouth. Our server was a pleasant gal  Julia  but the outstanding feature was the sea view. A little too chilly to have our lunch on the deck  but we were seated by the window. Mesmerizing! Add the guitars with the live music  and a memorable lunch was had. But then the bill arrived  I was astounded by how overpriced it was. Guess that's the amenities price  but all the other restaurants in the area are not that over priced. Just an FYI.

287,My pizza joint mission is on a roll  visiting places that serve slices and this was on my list. It was around two in the afternoon and it was time to get a couple slices. Counter service like all real pizza joints and I guess because of covid  there was no indoor seating nor outdoors  this was no concern to me. I ordered the two slice deal and sat in the shade by my car. I will say this  the crust was thin crispy and perfectly done. However  I will say this  they use a lower quality cheese and perhaps too much. Yea  I know  too much cheese? With too much low quality cheese I really couldn't get a take on the sauce. My recommendation to the owner would be get a better cheese  use less and it could be a four start pizza.

288,Cool ambiance. Food was OK. I ordered the Sausage Risotto and my husband got the wagyu steak. He commented that he's had better steak for a lot less price. The Risotto was fine but I feel like there are probably better meals on the menu. I'd consider going back and trying something else. The service was kind of slow but it didnt bother me too much because it let me slow down and take in the night. But heed the warning if you have firm plans after dinner; give yourself more time. They have a piano man with table service on the piano. I'd love to do that sometime!,Neutral,0.85
289,My partner had the Parma Hash which he enjoyed very much. I had the Classic Eggs Benedict which was okay but not great. Was lukewarm  possibly because of the cold tomato that was part of the dish. Service was perfunctory.,Complaint,0.9
290,Only giving this place a 3 star rating because the manager made up for all the mistakes with mu hubby's meal by comping our whole meal! My husband ordered eggs benedict with the eggs poached hard ( he doesn't like runny yolk ) First order  the eggs were totally runny! Sent it back  the second time  they had very little sauce! So he asked just for some more sauce & they said no we'll have them make it again  took forever! He waited about 45 mins! I was done with mine by the time they got his right! Unacceptable! Will probably not be back! Too bad. We feel like ever since the pandemic  the customer service industry has just gone downhill! They don't care at all,Complaint,0.97
291,So  went here for me and my boyfriends 1 year anniversary. The atmosphere was beautiful  very inviting. The salad bar was horrible. The food brought to you by waiters was good  the meat was great. But there were no sides....so it was a shitty salad bar with a lot of meat. It was $65 a plate  which honestly I'd rather go to a really fancy restaurant and get a MEAL..not some glorified BBQ. I would suggest replacing the literal potato salad and glazed peanut bar with vegetables  noodles  rice  mashed potatoes  stews. Went for the gimic  won't go back for the food.,Suggestion,0.92
292,The frybread was good but it didn't have any sauce or toppings other than lettuce and cheese which made it rather dry and chewy.,Complaint,0.88
293,We came here on NYE. Our service was great the waitress was a doll and I had no issues with that. The food is underwhelming and I think over priced. My tenderloin was small and lacked flavor: the pasta course was slimy and the broth was too strong. Salad was good. The crème brûlée which I would've loved to order was ruined by adding ginger. I got blackberry sorbet. Meh. For the cost of the food I would think they could update the interior  it is dated with diff light fixtures and no consistent design or ambience. Same as it was 15 years ago. The other restaurant they own is Acero and that is one of my favorite places. They are very nice here but I'm not rushing back.,Complaint,0.94
294,We tried this Diner today finally after moving in a few months ago. This place is ALWAYS busy  which to me  means it's mighty tasty. I was greeted over the phone by Meredith  who was sooo nice and friendly! Her customer service was great but unfortunately   the food missed the seasoning mark this morning. I ordered a variety of things: The Apollo omelette  an order of French toast and the corned beef hash breakfast. On the plus side  the French toast was buttery and thick but nothing out of the ordinary. The omelette  grits and hash browns were absent of any type of seasoning (not salt and pepper  but actually seasonings)  which was disappointing. I didn't taste any passion!,Complaint,0.91
295,I've been here at least 50 times and it seems to slowly be going down hill. I'd like to chalk the issues up to being short staffed due to COVID  but it was more than that. The food was lukewarm and slow to come out. If my food i slow then it should at least be hot. Consistently  the service has been lackadaisical  but if you do get lucky enough to sit up stairs that does not seem to be the case.,Complaint,0.93
296,This place was the old prime bar. It's very spacious and our waitress was very nice. I ordered the Fabio meatball sub with sweet potato fries for lunch. The meal came out fast but my sandwich was luke warm. The meatballs were decent  nothing to get all crazy about like they make it using the chefs name. The sandwich was overall good because the meatballs were spiced nice but a little too soft for me probably from too much filling. My friend got the fish and chips and said it was good.,Neutral,0.85
297,Wanted to try a new spot during restaurant week and this menu caught my husband and I'd eye. We had a reservation but had to wait a bit outside which was not ideal but fine. Service was quick to start and we were able to put in our order  get our apps and entrees pretty quickly. The food was subpar. I did not like the meatballs at all  I'm not sure what it was but something tastes off. The arancini was okay. Both entrees  chicken parm and short rib ravioli were just okay but lacked flavor. After we were done eating it took about 20 minutes for the waitstaff to finally come and get our plates and bring dessert. I try not to judge restaurants during restaurant week as they are usually very busy but not excuse for bland food. We won't be back.,Complaint,0.92
298,Although I'm rating this place 3 stars  I did enjoy my dinner here. I think the main draw to this place is its atmosphere and friendly staff. It's not a fancy place but there was a fun New Orleans style band playing and the dance floor was jumping! I found the food to be mediocre. I had the gumbo and the New Orleans BBQ shrimp. Both were just meh. However  the Bread Pudding was fantastic! Best if shared with someone  in fact  it's served with 2 spoons.,Neutral,0.82
299,Why this place is so popular is beyond me. Tuesday lunchtime it was like a cattle call for this cash-cow business. I ordered a Queen Margherita Pizza that was more like a soft crusted flatbread. For $10.99 I received a portion that was no larger than a slice of $2.99 Pizza. Same goes for the salads  very small portions for lettuce and a few ingredients. That said  the food was decent and enjoyable. It was so busy I was surprised when my order arrived promptly. The poor employees were working like dogs to keep up with the volume of to-go orders  I felt sorry for them. One big plus  actual linen napkins which I appreciated. Worth a try but it will cost you $30 for lunch per couple with tip.,Complaint,0.89

303,Was very excited to have a new coffee place nearby. Ordered a latte. Didn't love my coffee  in fact  I took two sips in the parking lot and didn't finish it. It tasted burnt but not like burnt coffee. It had very little (weak) coffee flavor it just tasted burnt. Will try one more time and update otherwise I'll stick with my other local favorite coffee places. Space is not welcoming. It's not like a cozy cafe where you can sit and read a book while you enjoy your beverage. There's furniture for sale and a one seat hair salon tucked in the corner. However  owners son was a great guy! Very friendly  happy  and kind. He gets 5 for service!,Complaint,0.93

305,You kno. It was OK. Doesn't live up to the 5star hype. I ordered a side chili rellano. It comes enchilada style. Covered w enchilada sauce. I don't like wet rellanos. I'm glad I ordered it dry w sauce on the side. I did not like the enchilada sauce. Also ordered the 2 enchilada plate one chicken one shredded beef. Good basic enchilada but again wasn't impressed w the sauce. The small 2 oz guacamole I ordered was inundated w tomato chunks. Didn't care for that. The chips & salsa was ok. Had to salt them to taste good. Bathroom was clean. Restaurant is clean. Waiter wore mask,Complaint,0.9
306,I love the food here  but your bottomless system sucks. Bartender shoo'd me away from the bar because I went to inquire after my drink sat empty for over 20 mins. She was rude and the man who was behind the bar already was clearly bothered to follow me to the table to pour my drink. Maybe come up with a better system as this was a very poor experience and not my first time.,Complaint,0.95
307,Came here for a friend's birthday and was immediately impressed with how clean and modern the interior was. Definitely a bit more upscale than your typical hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. Altogether  3 of us ordered 5 dishes (including 2 appetizers) : Dan Dan noodles  scallion pancakes  fatty beef sour radish soup  salt and pepper dried squid  and spicy lamb chops. Squid was an easy favorite  but I'm always a sucker for that chewy goodness. I have to give a special shout out to the radish soup. I would order this dish again just for the noodles. They had this almost firm-Jello-like consistency that gave the most perfect bite! And the broth itself was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it. Wouldn't order the lamb chops again - meat was dry and it didn't go too well with the cumin marinade. A bit on the pricier end  but I think it's appropriate for the vibe and quality of food.,Neutral,0.82

353,Dined here by myself last night and it was Ok  but not great. The front of the restaurant is piled up with used boxes and tables with chairs piled up on them  such that I wasn't sure if it was open or open just for take out. When I peeked around the corner I could see that there were about a dozen tables and just one was occupied. Perhaps the owners should clean up the place and take a little pride of ownership. I ordered a side salad and a bowl of #12 Pho. The salad consisted of iceberg lettuce  and iceberg lettuce. Nothing else. I don't believe there was any dressing on it either but if there was it had no taste. As for the Pho  was somewhat tasty but it was served to me just barely lukewarm  not hot as I would expect a hearty soup with noodles to be served. I sent it back and ask them to please warm it up for a few minutes. Now...I am an experienced Vietnamese food eater  (which is why I chose this restaurant)  but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. My experience here was subject to the fact that I was very hungry having spent the day traveling from the East Coast. The service was average--they seemed overwhelmed filling take-out orders. Would I go back? Hmmmm. I'll keep searching.,Complaint,0.95
354,"The service was good  the prices are reasonable  but the food was just so-so. I'd order the enchiladas again  but the rice was dry. My companions ordered the chimichanga and burrito grande.

The spicier the better  and this was just typical  restaurant-grade. Nothing to write home about.",Complaint,0.85
355,Good food with a lousy service! We dined outside due to COVID reasons. Once seated it took 20 mins to just get water  the restaurant wasn't even at 50% capacity.

We asked a question about kids menu which she said I will check with the chef  guess what? 20 more mins without any reply with the same waitress serving other tables. We ordered chorisso stuffed chicken  truffled gnocchi and saffron salmon  all were quite good. Giving a 3 star for the good food but lousy service.,Complaint,0.95

360,I pass this place all the time and I decided to give it a try today  bad idea  I walked in and had to stand there for a few min because the sign says to wait to be seated  there were only 2 tables being occupied  and one waitress that needs a class in customer service  she acted like she had an attitude when she seated me . I decided what I wanted to eat and had to sit there another 10-15 min before she came and took my order  she brings me my food  but I had no silverware  so I had to wait till she brought my silverware  the food was horrible I have never seen egg drip soup so thick and disgusting  it literally looked like snot with peas in it  the rice was tasteless  and the sweet and sour chicken had no taste. So needless to say I left just as hungry as I did when I walked in. I will never patronize Sky Dragon ever again.,Complaint,0.98

362,Not sure why all the bad reviews. We've been ordering take out from here weekly for nearly four years and have few to no complaints. The pizza is consistently fresh  hot  and good. From time to time we also get the boneless wings and found them to be tasty. We order online  and the pizza is always ready by the time we reach the store. This locations has a pick up window and u can pay on line so make it extremely awesome and save specially during the pandemic before vaccines. is important to mention the people at the pick up window re always super nice never have any problems  no attitude and no drama. Has there been some mess ups? Of course. A couple of pizzas came out undercooked  or they get an order wrong. These are a rarity given the frequency of our orders but a quick call to the manager and they fix the problem right away either with re-macking the pizza or giving a credit for next order. The important thing is they have always made it right. Not everyone like Pizza Hut pizza  but that's a personal preference. for us this location is and always be our Pizza Friday and yes we obviously like it! I'm giving 4 stars because there is always improve so when the time comes will give the 5 star.,Neutral,0.85
363,I go to the eegees on st marys maybe twice a week or so. They're great there. The employees are friendly. The food is almost always on point. But there have been a few times where they've messed it up- but when I go back they fix it with a smile. Their fries are always made to order so they're always fresh. I just wish they'd even out their fizz drinks  about half the time you only get like a squirt of soda. And it would be cool if they had more flavors of their slushees. But the restaurant is super clean  as well as the bathrooms  you can see right into the kitchen and see it's just as clean- all their employees wear masks too.,Suggestion,0.9
364,I've been here about 10 times. Every single time I've been here the staff seems to be upset with my presence. No matter who I'm with or how I am. Every time since day one. Even the waitresses that are completely fake nice  you can tell they are secretly plotting your death. Food is pretty good although a bit overpriced in my opinion. Atmosphere is all right. Beer- eh. Pretty loud in there too. like they could use some sound baffling. Props on having shuffle board and pool. My least favorite part of this place is the stuffed bear. Not because of animal rights or anything but because it's completely in the way and I bump into it every time I go to the bathroom. Pretty gross cause I'm sure everyone else does it too. Covid super spreader right there. All this being said I'll probably definitely go back. But maybe in a few months.,Complaint,0.9

366,"2nd visit. First was a Yelp sponsored event. The $5.00 (small pitcher) before 5 is a definite pull for me. I tried the tomato soup this visit. Very good. Not like the milk based I grew up with back east. More of a Mediterranean style which I now prefer. Was not aware you can order individual board items  $4 ea  we ordered artichoke toast great  and second time ordering the Tuna sandwich w chips. My only criticism is the same Tuna w chips we ordered at the Yelp event was ""stuffed "" w tuna and piled high w chips. Not so today. Lots of bread and few chips to share. Likely to return for $5 before 5 and homemade soups.",Complaint,0.85
367,"This is a new Burmese/Thai/sushi restaurant on Northside of town across from North Central high-school. Cute little restaurant  clean  very atune service. Food was good. Got fried spring rolls  steamed chicken dumplings  pad ka prao minced chicken  and Burmese curry noodle soup. The soup was certainly the highlight of the meal. Very similar ingredients to a kao soi but no crunchy rice noodles and a thinner  ""soupier"" broth. Reminded me of consistency of a Tom kha soup. It was exceptional. The pad ka prao is sliced meat here but they made it thai style by request by mincing meat. The entree comes with side of jasmine rice topped with fried egg. The stir fry was good  not overly sweet or overly basil flavored. It is in the middle of pack as far as this particular dish goes around indy metro. The spring rolls and dumplings were both fair as well. Definitely will be back to try more entrees  menu items to gather better opinion. Great to have another thai spot in metro.",Neutral,0.85

369,Very beautiful restaurant. It's pretty much an upscale pho restaurant. The pho was actually pretty good for a suburban area. A great place to get pho if you don't want to drive to Philly and deal with the vaccine mandate or just don't want to go to Philly in general. Probably the best authentic pho I had outside of Philly. They're generous with their meats and noodles. The broth was a little lacking to me but nothing a little bit of fish sauce and hoisin/sriracha couldn't fix. I would also recommend their summer rolls. It was so fresh and now those were the best summer rolls I've ever had. I would definitely come back for them! I didn't try their Japanese cuisine but it was pretty much just sushi. A little bit on the pricey side but they have uni and toro! Now that's legit. Try them out if you like pho and sushi,Neutral,0.85

Please keep in mind there is no wait staff. You have to order at the bar. I had the panini which came with truffle fries. The prosciutto had a strong taste which I personally did not care for but if you like prosciutto I'm sure this sandwich would work you. The truffle fries were delicious. I ate them all and they were cold! The king cake beignet had the traditional beignet dough flavor with a sweet glaze. The filling tasted of cream cheese and walnuts. I tried the queso and was surprised it tasted so freshly made. The flatbread was amazing. I'll get it next time I go. I also want to try the beignet flight.

It can be pricey if you choose lobster or king crab  but you can keep the cost down with cheaper but yummy options. We had fun and will go back. The Cajun spice was good. I will probably just do garlic sauce next time. I'm allergic to shrimp and was happy that I didn't have a reaction when I just ordered clams and muscles.

It is a bit rambunctious due to the kitchen being open  but it creates a very unique dining experience and ambiance for diners. We ordered a vodka lemon martini  which was excellent. For dinner  we ordered Caesar salad  which was a perfect compliment to my ribeye  and my fiancé's chicken Parmesan. My ribeye was ordered medium rare  and cooked to the correct temperature. It did lack flavor  but it was a solid steak--nothing too excellent but satisfying. My fiancés chicken parm was excellent  unfortunately it was probably better than my steak  but a knockout for the menu for sure! Service was sufficient  but not excellent due to them being busy  totally understandable. This is a solid restaurant if in the area.,Neutral,0.75

383,We rolled into Clearwater in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the weekend of the outback bowl! Tons of Razorbacks and Nittany Lions everywhere in the street and on the beach it was great to see the crowds enjoying the beautiful Florida weather. This location of the clear sky has been a favorite of ours for years because it's steps away from the public access to the beach. After a nice long walk on the beach my husband and I slipped into a beautiful table outside just in time for the happy hour half-price drinks who doesn't love it! We ordered fried grouper bites excellent  as well goat cheese portobello mushroom flatbread a little bit more of a cracker and too crispy for me wouldn't get it next time but very tasty. My husband had the grill triggerfish sandwich which was delicious and of course you know you just need a few extra things so we took home a burger that's a crowdpleaser all the time. Service is great outdoor people watching excellent and the food is is good. Live music Sunday - steel drum solo man with great rhythm and a great singing voice.

384,This fun shop had good seating  live music on a Saturday  and great cappuccino. Would have easily given 5 stars if we had been acknowledged by the barista  been asked to wait as he was obviously short staffed or maybe even received a smile. I would go back because I like the name  but the coffee is good too.,Complaint,0.9
385,Nice vibe and good food  service was fast. I was having Creole food for first time  while it was good  it will not be on top of my list. Expect to be surprised by the taste. The portions are small so pls order side dishes and appetizers. Good tropical daiquiris which are a must.,Neutral,0.8

388,I've been coming to this quaint little restaurant in Safety Harbor for over 10 years. Another 'go to' place for me. Great menu variety - definitely something for everyone  tots of beers on tap and great service. I always go for the Fried Green Tomatoes - just delicious. It's usually my spot for a light lunch of assorted appetizers after a long walk between parks. Mostly all outdoor seating- open air - sun and shade it's a great place to unwind and take in the relaxing vibes of Safety Harbor!,Neutral,0.95
389,A cute little space in the CBD. Outdoor seating was available  and looked very nice  but it was too cold to sit outside. Service was right on top of our needs  making sure our drinks and water never were empty. Appetizers (shareables) were good portion sized  the meals were very good.,Neutral,0.9

391,This place is always very consistent with their food and the service. The location is great...(a few steps outside the Quarter.)

392,Was looking for somewhere close to work to get food from. Delivery here through DoorDash was going to be $23 just for a $12 burger so I decided to just go get it. Aside from the gluten free bread tasting like a sponge  everything was fine;,Complaint,0.85
393,went to the bar and got the garden of greens drink with rum. very yummy  only taking away one star because it was $12. i like the atmosphere here and the bartender was very friendly!,Complaint,0.8
394,Reluctantly tried this today  despite the rating. The gentleman that was serving was in on the ball and friendly. (Hard to find in today's labor pool.). Service was quick for only having one person serving. I did the triple entree  and was pleasantly surprised. The orange sesame chicken was cooked perfectly and delicious. Green beans were crisp and well seasoned. I tried the spicy potatoes  which were delicious. My only reason for the 4-star rating was the potatoes. Had they been cooked a little softer to be able to cut wit plastic ware or maybe just cubed or even cut to half the size for easier eating  that would have pushed the 5th star. Glad I stopped here for lunch while in the mall.,Suggestion,0.85
395,If you've ever enjoyed Paradise bakery (rip)  this is absolutely the place to go. Their tomato soup is AMAZING. I go here just for the soup! Outside of that  their customer service is good. They have fantastic soups & salads and everything comes with a cute little croissant. Try this place out!,Neutral,0.95

397,I was down for the count  and had been making my rounds getting different kinds of soup.. it was Pho's turn... I actually thought this was the place I normally go to but apparently it was not... I was not at all disappointed tho... I got the brisket & ribeye pho and it was delicious... the broth is every so slightly sweet but also peppery it was right on point with what I needed in the moment. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can see why the reviews are all positive. I now have an additional place to get great Pho... I'm looking forward to trying other menu items.,Neutral,0.95
398,Not bad. We had the Cuban pollo platter which was very tasty. The chicken breast was small and dry but the flavor- just the right amount and combo of spices - was good. The beans and rice were excellent and the maduros were absolutely addicting. It gets a minus one star for uncomfortable seating inside and out; and dirty tables and floors.,Complaint,0.9
399,Food was very good and the view was fantastic. We sat outside for the kite festival and enjoyed ourselves. Our waiters name was Devon who was very friendly and attentive. They have valet parking and let us keep our car beyond the 2 hour request. I am not giving this 5 stars because of the front reception staff. We weee told we didn't need a reservation for lunch to just come back to the desk to be seated (we had 45 minutes till lunch service). When we did my husband was greeted by a rude young man who said they weren't seated. My husband explained and ultimately requested the manager who was pleasant and seated us. Overall good experience except for the hic,Complaint,0.85
400,Great outside dining area. We were there on a Sunday for a Sunday brunch which their brunch menu is somewhat limited. The food was good. I had the Salmon bowl and the salmon was cooked perfectly. My wife did have the bottomless Mimosas. Prices are reasonable.,Neutral,0.9
401,I love going to this place  the views are pretty awesome. The food is good  especially the blue cheese chips are so amazing. Also the sweet tea is the best sweet tea I've ever had. The service was actually pretty good for us each time we went. I tried before the boneless wings and the cheese burger  they were both pretty mediocre. However I'd still keep going back.,Neutral,0.75

My server asked all the right questions that fit with my group dynamic - checked on my at least four times during the meal - he was just 'all over it' with all his guests - He had the Perfect disposition for his job! I ordered the regular ribeye but asked to have it fire grilled. It was cooked just as I like it - med rare and was just delicious. I added mushrooms and onions   which I love and they were also cooked well. Sides were cooked perfectly - sweet potato and garlic butter asparagus It was an overall really good experience.,Neutral,0.95

The portions wasn't as much as i thought honestly should of gotten the large,Complaint,0.85
406,We were able to make reservations for New Years Eve which was such a nice treat since most big events in the city were cancelled. The staff was very welcoming and seated us about 10 minutes after our reservation time (not bad considering it was very busy!) Our order was taken quickly and the server took care of our wine (no corking fee...bonus!) Our four course meal was up charged to $85pp because of the holiday. It took a while to get each course  however I believe it was because the restaurant was rather busy. The burrata was good  not great. It had a caprese style to it  so maybe my personal preference but I didn't love. The gnocci was good  not great. A little too oily for my preference. My third course was another pasta option which was good but not bursting with flavor. When it came time for dessert  it had been over two hours since we started to eat so we decided to take it home. I got the lemon blueberry oil cake and it was delicious! Overall our experience was good not great. I think the $85pp up charge was a bit of a turnoff  however it was NYE so that is to be expected. The food wasn't amazing but it was still good! Our servers and staff were all wonderful and the ambiance of the restaurant was very cute! Would I go back? Maybe! Just not for an $85 pre fixe meal.,Complaint,0.8
407,Vibe is amazing. Not a long wait time. Food was great but wish there was a larger list of options on menu.,Suggestion,0.9
408,Pretty decent. I want to give only 3 stars but something more like 3 and half would be more appropriate. The food has potential to be so delicious but I'm not sure if we came on an off day but everything was kind of lacking flavor. The mimosas were okay. I think I just personally prefer OJ. The beni could've been good if the asparagus was cook a bit more and the hollandaise had just a touch more flavor. The poutine was our favorite thing; could use a bit more of the gravy but still delicious. I would like to return some day for a second chance.,Suggestion,0.85
409,When you wake up groggy from a night of fighting with electrical issues  you want breakfast that can be delivered quick and be hearty. Well  I found it with Wendy's yesterday. Through their magical app  where you can also get points for freebies later  I placed the order for the fam  it gets dispatched to the store  and DoorDash handles the logistics. I was lucky enough to not only have a Dasher close by for immediate pickup  the order was correct  and most importantly HOT!!!! This store goes through its pains of staffing and sometimes does not always read notes in full. The only reason I'm giving 4-stars this go around is a miss on some order notes. When someone requests coffee with cream and sugar  sugar is not equal and sweet & low; both of which not the best for the body. Other than that the cold brew was amazing!!! Thanks for great food and a great recharge at an affordable value and was worth every bit of it and delivered in just about 25-30 minutes time. Can't wait to order again soon!!!,Complaint,0.85
410,My first time visiting the P&P on Grant after being a loyal Campbell Ave customer. I don't know if it's the 'state of things' or what  and it's subtle but still  I noticed corners cut. I've ordered the everything croissant sammie  like  every time I come. It's the best. And I know what it COULD be. And this one  well  WASN'T. This time it seemed like there's less 'everything' on the croissant  the whole thing wasn't really warm  the eggs were weird flat scrambled patties  the cheese wasn't exactly melted  and the croissant itself wasn't as fluffy and awesome. The crispy potatoes were mostly whole. Don't get me wrong  the flavors were there. But it wasn't the same. If this is what it's going to be like from now on I'll be sad. Still top notch French 75s though!,Complaint,0.95

414,Found a new Chinese spot on the block and we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend thought the soy ribs were okay. It had good flavor but it was on the dry side. The salt & pepper shrimp was pretty good. Did not lack in flavor. The combo fried noodles was probably everyone's favorite. The fried pot stickers is a 8/10. Lastly  the bao was probably the most disappointing thing for me. It was so salty that I felt like it was dipped into the ocean. Hopefully they make the bao less salty in the future. Overall  everything was pretty good. Environment : This location is the old Korean restaurant. Everything inside still remains the same. Therefore  the parking spots are still tight and small. Service: there was a nice sweet man that greeted us and cashed us out. The restaurant itself didn't have many customers when we arrived so hopefully this business gets more customers so it can keep running. I would rate this place a 7/10 from the food we got.,Complaint,0.93
415,This is a good place for breakfast! We go often. The pancakes are huge. The skillets are delicious. The French toast is yummy. The OJ is refreshing. They try to be as healthy as possible. There are several options for those watching their diet & vegetarians. They always have these nutritious juice blends. They also write certain seasonal specials on the chalk board. The service is great. People are very friendly & helpful. I definitely recommend.,Neutral,0.9

417,I first had this 4 years ago in cincy. When I found out they had a location in Indy  I had to go. I ordered the same exact meal I had 4 years ago plus a few extras. The chicken club  Mac and cheese  sweet potatoes  cornbread  succotash  herb fries. It was CFP championship day so they were prepping for the long night. We got there at 4 right when they opened and they were already crowded. The sandwhich was good  It didn't wow me like before. The Mac and cheese are just spiral noodles with a wet cheese sauce  the sweet potatoes were cold and the marshmallows were charred but not warm (these were replaced and not charged when we requested a fresh order)  fries were delicious and flavorful  the cornbread was probably my favorite side  the succotash was also cold. I'm not taking off many stars because I understand the rush and trying to be prepared. The 4 stars is cause the flavor was there  was just lacking in temperature. Would def go back to watch a sports game  it's the perfect set up!,Complaint,0.94
418,I come here every trip to New Orleans sometimes I eat here twice. If it is lunch  it the Ferdi  if it is breakfast  it's an shrimp étouffée omelette. Trust me  don't be talked into substituting shrimp creole for shrimp étouffée; it's no contest.,Neutral,0.86
419,So glad they opened this second location so I don't have to hunt for and then pay for parking to visit the restaurant. Also don't have to contend with the traffic on Mandalay Avenue. Friendly staff. I ordered takeout of tuna and salmon nigiri and it was very FRESH  well packed  with high quality ginger and strong wasabi. Look forward to visiting again. I ordered my takeout by walking into the store  but I noticed today that there's a separate door or window around the corner  on the side street  that said 'PICKUP' or 'TAKEOUT.'

421,I eat here at least twice a week. This particular location always runs out of essential ingredients in the evening  such as avocado  certain type of bread  arugula  certain cheese  certain chicken  even apple--you name it  they don't have it. Not sure if this is part of the supply chain issue or it's just not properly managed. Other than the 'sold out' issue mentioned above  it's a typical Panera Bread.,Complaint,0.96

423,Got two pizzas for takeout on NYE. The husband and I really liked the traditional hand-stretched crust. We got the rosemary potato and the wild mushroom pizzas  and they let me order the wild mushroom with red sauce (as opposed to the traditional white). I thought the rosemary potato was a litttttle too salty (the spinach or the olive tapenade) and had to alternate bites with the crust to even out the flavors  but the wild mushroom was excellent. Will definitely dine in to try some of their other pizzas and entrees at some point!,Complaint,0.91

429,Jeannine's is a nice breakfast and brunch spot across from the wharf with ocean views. I ordered a simple two egg breakfast with toast and fresh squeezed orange juice. I placed a to go order and enjoyed my breakfast in the sand! The staff were very welcoming and quickly took my order. While I waited  I noticed how cute and quaint this place is. I was quickly served and left to the beach to enjoy. I would say my breakfast was about 3.5 and the juice and service was a 5! My eggs and potatoes were meh and sourdough was good. I think next time I will try a pastry (that seems to be the thing to get at Jeannine's).,Neutral,0.86

I would have given Bocca 5 stars  but I came here with friends one time and checked the website to see if they were open  they were... but once we got there they were closed for a private party with the doors locked. Also  came for a birthday celebration and the owner/manager was slightly cold. My recommendations  the baked goat cheese and beet salad to start. For an entree  the della casa  but substitute the shrimp for ground sausage. Finally  finish it off with the bombolini.,Complaint,0.94

436,Some of the best chicken wings anywhere PERIOD. Hooters got nothing on these wings. KFC you must have missed the cooking lesson that the head chef here attended cause you could use the help. This would open Popeye's other eye in surprise. Nowhere in Buffalo can touch this place and I hit at least 15 places up there looking for great wings. Oh  BTW  They have great Pho Ga and other Vietnamese dishes. Only big negative is that they do not have a grilled chicken dish on the menu. So my go to Grilled Chicken Vermicelli is absent and no 5 starts for this place.,Complaint,0.95
437,Classic dishes with a historical NOLA feel. I loved the decor and music of Brennan's! I felt transported back in time. We ordered the 'A Chanteclaire Christmas' and 'Advent En Audubon' and they both tasted well balanced. I really enjoyed my turtle soup and my boyfriend enjoyed his potato rosti. The ham and eggs were a little dry in our croque madames. I also couldn't really taste the black truffle in the croque madame. My boyfriend thought the cheddar grits were very good. The banana foster was great! I loved the flambé at the table. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear the history of the banana foster that I heard other servers explaining to the tables around us. Despite the minor critiques I've written  I would recommend Brennan's to friends and family. I would like to return to try their dinner menu in the future!,Complaint,0.92
438,Cool vibe  great drinks  inside and outside seating. Great menu This is a great place to go for a date night or drinks with friends.

We shared our entrees I had the gyro with roasted potatoes and my husband tried the calamari which came with rice  bread  green beans and potatoes. The location is on a side street from 36 you may not see it from 36 but worth looking for. Next time we're definitely trying the flaming cheese appetizer. Back here today for lunch.

It's the only cafe I've seen that offers misugaru  a grain-based breakfast drink. Since I'd only ever had it from the instant packets that a friend shared with me  I had to give that a try. They've got breakfast sandwiches with bibimbap that I need to go back to try. And the dalgona coffee  too. They use local La Colombe and Caphê coffees and Philly muffins. Great local business!,Neutral,0.87
443,Loved the area & ambience  super cute. We only got to try one item but will be back for sure. The Smoked Pastrami Reuben on Seeded Rye was delicious. It was a good portion & tasted really good.

The side salad was very nice & refreshing  with great dressing.,Complaint,0.85

I found a sandwich that I was in love with  but they removed it from the menu! Great grilled cheese here!!! Handmade aprons and cool little gifts... Definitely check it out. The staff is super nice! Avocado BLT  Chicken Goat  Roast Beef Sandwich  and Charcuterie are some great choices.,Complaint,0.8
445,I've been on hunt for a great study/work spot to hang out in when I need a change of scenery and I got just that. The atmosphere is so inviting and cozy here. There is plenty of seating so you don't have to worry about popping in for work and not being able to find a seat. The noise level was also perfect. I was a little worried that because this is a bigger coffee shop and it's downtown  it may be loud but it really wasn't. I ordered a cafe con leche and a Cuban sandwich and everything tasted delicious  flavorful and fresh. They do make the cafe con leche with condensed milk instead of regular milk which resulted in a foamier coffee. However the Cuban sandwich was made to perfection. I can tell it was fresh because the cheese melts away with each bite and each component of the sandwich was crispy and hot just the way I love it! All in all  if you're looking for a chill study or workspace  I'd encourage you to stop by. I can't wait to come back!,Neutral,0.95
446,Stopped here for lunch since I have never been to one before. Our waitress was very nice and patient with us since we had to research the menu a little before ordering. I ordered the half salad half club sandwich meal. It was a much larger portion size than I expected and was very good. I had to take home half of the sandwich. Prices were fair and they do have a full bar if you are interested. I will be back next time I am in town.,Neutral,0.97

After browsing through the menu we decided to order Crispy Spring Rolls  Veggie Pad Thai and Veggie Red Curry. We got our order in 10 minutes. The food was freshly cooked and it was hot. The spring rolls were perfectly fried as well as we loved the pad Thai and vegetable red curry. It was different from the normal Thai restaurant as it was all cooked with veggies.,Neutral,0.98

The lunch specials are great and comes with 1  2  or 3 meats; a side; and a cornbread muffin (which was frankly the best cornbread I've ever had). I ordered the 2 meat combo ($11.50 at lunch) and requested the brisket and the bbq chicken. The brisket was flavorful and juicy  which was great. The chicken was OK. it was definetly juicy which is good  but I wish I would've realized I could've asked for the spicier sauce. The original BBQ sauce is just too sweet for my liking. Ultimately  I think we'll be back if we're ever wanting some bbq!,Suggestion,0.9
449,Very nice. 4 25 Unassuming nice little spot  friendly service and nice conversation w/ what might be the owner or manager. Sangria and beer. Lots of delivery-take-out happening. If anyone had to wait on their pick up  they were offered a water or drink while they wait. Super nice. We tried the lomo salteado  which did not disappoint- steak  soy  garlic onions tomato peppers still a bit crispy fry base and side of fluffy arroz. Hubs tried the chaufa chicken   Peruvian fried rice  ok but a little 5 spice flavor which we don't love. It's like cilantro  not everyone is a fan! Eager to try the rotisserie chicken and maybe a delightful delicious dessert!,Neutral,0.96

I wouldn't go out of my way just for the beer but I would for the overall experience.,Neutral,0.97

There is a small outside seating area that is put up outside during the summer months  when the weather permits. COVID-19 protocols are practiced here. The owners are very friendly  helpful and inviting. I have not had a bad meal here. This is my go to spot when I have cheesesteak cravings. The cheesesteaks only come in one size. Hot sandwiches  cold sandwiches  pasta dishes  salads are a few categories to choose from. You can dine in or order to go. You can even use food delivery services. Grub Hub or Doordash provide coverage for this establishment. Cash/Credit or debit are accepted here.,Neutral,0.98
452,Delicious chicken  yummy sauce  friendly staff  and crinkle fries! I usually don't like crinkle fries because they remind me of old soggy school cafeteria fries... & these fries came kind of soggy  but I was able to reheat my fries in the airfryer at home which made them 1000x better!!! The toast that came with the chicken finger combo was nice and buttery. The buns on the sandwich combo was soft and fresh. The chicken is so well-seasoned! I couldn't stop dipping the fries in the sauce! Sooo good! The drive thru line is usually busy  but for good reason!! So if you ever see it not busy  GO GET SOME! Even if you're not hungry. Bring it home and reheat it in the airfryer. If you don't have an airfryer  what year are you living in????? How are you surviving life without one?? Go get some chicken and an airfryer.,Complaint,0.85

456,I visited your establishment with a group of 12. Crystal did a great job on providing great service. I enjoyed the Pork Ossobuco. The rest of the group enjoyed there meals as well. My only surprise through out the evening is when I asked for an espresso. How can an Italian Restaurant not have espresso? If had one suggestion that is what I would suggest.,Suggestion,0.95
457,I made reservations a week in advance due to the weekend being New Years Eve weekend. Checking in was smooth  the host sat us early. It took a while for the waitress to take our order but it wasn't a huge issue since we weren't in a rush. The restaurant had a special NYE menu that day so we weren't able to try the other dishes which is shown in the other customer's images. That was disappointing since there wasn't a huge selection of dishes that night. So I felt a bit robbed. Anyway  I ordered a half dozen oysters  gator bites  and the Louisiana sampler (jambalaya  crawfish Étouffée  red beans and rice  and gumbo)  and for dessert the Bananas foster bread pudding. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the fresh oysters. The service was okay. Our waitress came off a little rude  slightly impatient  but I didn't want to hold it against her because it was a busy night. I just hope she doesn't act like that towards customers everyday. I do plan on returning in the future hoping that I'll get to try a full menu  instead of a limited menu.,Complaint,0.85
458,This place has great pizza. My usual go tos' - margarita pizza and plain with olives. Was perfectly sauced and toasted  thin and crispy perfection the way I prefer it. I usually just get pizza here  but the wings were good too!,Neutral,0.97
459,Great breakfast! The sausage  country potatoes and eggs over easy were all great tasting. The sausage was fresh tasting with great flavor. The potatoes were seasoned with spices I couldn't name  but I know good food. My orange was a nice compliment instead of coffee. However  my partner had coffee. There was no bread product that came with the meal  but since the restaurant also has a bakery there were lots of yummy choices. I ordered a chocolate eclair as a special breakfast dessert. The cream was thick and delicious on the eclair. It was way too much to eat  so I had some left over for later. The negative comments I have is that food was ordered at register and NO cash payments. One waiter/bus person for entire restaurant  so coffee refills were slow and waiter/bus person had to be flagged down for refills. Lastly  I liked the options of where to dine. Indoor or outdoors. We chose the outdoor table under an umbrella. It was perfect!,Complaint,0.85
460,Ate at the bar. Excellent margaritas. Not the cheap mix that gives me a headache  but fresh squeezed lime. The shrimp basket and grouper fish taco (a little cold) were delicious. Loses a star because this place is an absolute zoo. I feel like I was battling for a bar seat to avoid an hour wait. A place you should go at least once  but too crazy busy and took forever to get food  not to mention the level of aggression you must use to get the bar tenders attention.,Complaint,0.9
461,I visited blind tiger for the first time today after being a loyal Starbucks addict and i must admit  blind tiger has Starbucks beat by a long shot. I ordered a 16oz vanilla butterbean hot latte with almond mild and it was delicious. Not super sweet and a perfect brew. They also sell teas  pastries  hot breakfast  and bags of tea to brew at home. The only reason i didn't give a full 5 stars is because they are very expensive. The coffee was $8.06 and that would've afford me a venti coffee at Starbucks at least.,Complaint,0.85
462,I had a pizza craving and stopped here for a bite to eat. The pizza was fantastic and did not disappoint. The Toscano Pizza hit the spot with spinach  tomato and ricotta. I noticed they offer take out but no delivery which is another option. There are pasta choices too as the name implies. I have been here before and ordered a pasta meal. Either option is good eats. The only downside to this restaurant is the on-site parking. It wasn't an issue for me but could be a problem if you visit during a busy time. I did notice alternate parking on the other side of the street if on-site parking is not available.,Neutral,0.95
463,I ordered pizza's and jalapeño poppers for my family who were driving in from Ohio. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza  a Sicilian Mama's Supreme and two orders of jalapeño poppers. The pepperoni pizza was a thin crust and any of there Sicilian pizza's are a thick crust. My family loved the pizza's and poppers. The sauce was a little to sweet for me  but tasted good overall.,Neutral,0.96
464,One of the best Tres Leches cakes I have ever had ( and I really like Tres Leches) The cake was spongy and had the perfect texture for absorbing the milk. Even leftover  it was not soggy  and still delicious. I highly recommend this bakery for this cake and their fresh Mexican pastries.,Neutral,0.98
465,Pros: Cocktail shrimp appetizer was fresh and tasty  side of peewee potatoes were delicious  but the salad was an experiment gone awry. They just didn't pull off whatever they were attempting with the salad.,Complaint,0.9
466,We had some initial confusion with the hostesses about getting a table  as we did not have a reservation  but were seated at a nice table in the bar which was wonderful. Friendly service  good food...enjoyed the salads and sushi a lot. Just a note here that their Covid policy is outdated. Idaho is no longer in a state of emergency and totally open. Some employees choose to wear masks.,Neutral,0.95
