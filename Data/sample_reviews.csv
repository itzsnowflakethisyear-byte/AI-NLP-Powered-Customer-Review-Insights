review
"Third time is the straw. My order was missing the main topping. Salami of all things! You would think I would learn. Unfortunately I order through the app and this is the store I am required to use. The manager was not interested at ALL in fixing the problem! It didn't show on their end so not their problem! Screw customer service! I say screw them. Cold day in hell, before I order from them again!"
It use to be good food I always order there. two large cheese pizza and the whole thing was burnt I didn't even call them because they don't care. This is the second time I won't be coming here anymore going to Antonio's pizza
"Please don't go and waste your money. They should be ashamed of themselves. It's bad enough the food is overpriced but it's horrible to boot. Everything was served cold and over salted. The lobster mac and cheese was dry, their lobster tails were huge oysters from the gulf - poor quality ingredients with no taste. Go somewhere else. This place is like a dying horse. Someone needs to put it down. Restaurant smelled like an old Vegas carpet to boot. Dirty. SMH IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD. $800 wasted."
"I came in around 2:30pm on a Saturday and ordered the shrimp po-boy and their chargrilled oysters. The bread was stale and shrimp lacked flavor. Oysters were not great, pretty disappointing considering that's their thing. Service was very slow and the prices charged were not what was on their menu. Wouldn't recommend."
"Service has gone to the bottom. This particular Chik-fil-a needs to on ""Restaurants on Edge"". I can't understand why the line is all the way in the street just to turn around and have the wrong order given to me. The last straw, for me, was not having yogurt parfaits at 8:30 in the morning. You know how your mom says if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it?...sorry mom! Get it together! Some people actually depend on breakfast to carry them through lunch. How do you not have yogurt parfaits at 8:30? ""We were short staffed this morning."" All I could see was money being lost...where's the District Manager!!!! Help! How about bacon on my sandwich. I don't eat pork...wth? There is so much more to say...this is just MY beginning."
Come eat here if you like underpaid and overworked staff with mediocre food. Foods edible and over priced; just go to Ruth Chris and get a filet or pay $40 for steak fajitas your call . Staff is miserable including the General manager. I highly suggest crab claws for your meat...welll here we are over a year later no such thing as claws just tails oh yea and after tax $4 a soda. Enjoy the friendly atmosphere. Oh yea and dont forget that service charge on to go orders; it goes to the owner and the managers get the tips for bagging it wow yet they expect the servers to take phone orders what a joke. My friend ate ceviche and literally started to turn blue and the ambulance had to take her away when the french market location was open. That says enough
THEY ALWAYS GET THE ORDER WRONG!! At this point I am convinced they eat the food while cooking it. My dad ordered 15 wings and they came back with 13 wings. He also asked for large fries that he paid for and they gave him a small. Another time I ordered a cheesecake pie and it wasn't included at all in the order. This happens everytime we come to this BWW! We decided not to come back here ever again. I wouldn't recommend.
Pad Thai is more like pad pudding. Noodles overcooked. Eating Thai used to be good. Now they don't care. Overpriced substandard food.
"It doesn't get worse than this. A $28.00 charcuterie platter that consisted of less than one ounce each if meat and cheese and just covered in al disgusting manner with stale bread and crackers. Horrible NYE celebration and the manager was obtuse. No decent cheg would have allowed that plate to leave his kitchen. We live less than a mile away and will NEVER RETURN. We encourage all Yelp users to avoid this place. If you can't get a charcuterie platter right, how bad must everything that needs to be cooked be."
Ordered on Uber eats and only got part of my order. Called to say they forgot a half pound of burnt ends I was told no they combined them together. No we weighed them and it was only 8 ounces. Coleslaw had no flavor or seasoning. I was not impressed.
"Went just recently on Sunday. Over rated and over priced. Had prime rib and shrimp cocktail but prime rib extremely cold and shrimp overly cooked mushy. Cannot Believe I paid all that money to get the most delicious out of all the food the Pho - hot and tasty broth even with the Ok wontons. Grand Buffet is no longer ""Grand"". Things have changed with the times. I understand due to times the price increase but quality should still be there but no longer the case."
"Got it on Uber eats. Forgot our drinks, food was totally bland, both the lasagne and the chicken parmigiana. Was cold , pasta was watery and the side salad was a joke.$60 + waste of money ."
Don't order delivery. Third time in a row they have got my order wrong. I'm not sure what is going on over there. Recently I ordered 3 different orders of wings and a burger & they sent me one order of wings in the wrong flavor & a burger with just meat and a bun.
"I just paid $22 for this ""green curry with chicken"" didn't come with rice nor the vegetables described in the ad."
"So. I Googled best Mexican restaurants in Tucson and El Chinito Gordo came up. We looked at the menu online and thought we'd try it. Big mistake. The menu looks good and the young lady who served us was very sweet, but the food was awful. My husband had menudo and it was cold and not made with red chile sauce. The tripe was fatty, chewy and the hominy was straight out of the can uncooked. I had a chile relleno, which, was actually pretty good. However, I ordered beans and got rice. I had a Birria Gordita with it, and it was bland with very little meat. I ordered a house margarita, which was terrible. The chips and salsa were ok, we've had better. I feel bad, but this place was not good. Don't waste your money."
"This bar is my usual spot with my friends but last night things took a turn for the worst. The DJ randomly said over the speaker ""there's way too many black people here!"" This stupid little bar is clearly racist and I'm disgusted. I will not be going back to that shit hole."
Super disappointed I just ordered via Uber eats. It doesn't look like they added spirulina which I paid extra for and I asked for granola on the side and didn't get it which is basically my favorite part. Phone number on the receipt is invalid so can't even call to let them know.
Absolutely horrible service!!!! Not rating anything you can kiss my ass! This is just to INFORM the people that this is the worst place to go too!!! please don't go here and waste your time and money. You would have to wait for an HOUR for the food. I noticed that the Dave and busters in New Orleans has a bunch of black people and I love people of all colors! But Dave and busters has the WORST STAFF/EMPLOYEES EVER
"I really wish I could give 0 stars. Whoever the hell Tyler is, you're a horrible shitty manager... To let me explain.. we made an order at this specific sonic location on 1/13/2022 The order contained exactly 25.09 dollars of food we ordered. (For whatever reason sonic thinks they can get away with selling shitty food for that price but my girlfriend loves it so here we are) My girlfriend asked for a #1 combo, Simple cheeseburger. No lettuce, pickle tomato, onion, We received a sandwich that wasn't even the sandwich we ordered. It was very small in size. And contained no sauce and only onion. No biggie so we called the store. Friendly little chap Tyler answered. This is about how the call went Tyler: hello this is (shitty food place) Me: hi can I please speak to the manager? Tyler: speaking Me: explains the burger problem. And not getting what I paid for cause 25$ is a lot to spend on food that isn't what you asked Tyler: it looks like you didn't ask for no onion Me: but we did? Absolute silence.... Not a single word from this guys horrible monotone voice. Tyler: is there anything else I can do for you? I just decided to hang up. Lesson learned. Fuck sonic and fuck Tyler :)"
This establishment is violently racist. If you're African American or a person of color please spend your money somewhere else. This is not the place to be!!!
"Don't book a room here!! Could not cancel a reservation because my flight was delayed in the air due to high wind and I could not use my phone because I was in the air till after midnight on the day of the reservation. The manager would not refund and was extremely rude and hung up on me because I said ""this is the way you treat your customers"" she referred to this as ""verbal abuse"""
"This is our third time eating here. First time was really good. Had a crunchy chili relleno. Second time had the same again and it was eh ok. Last night we went and tried something different. I had the chicken fundido burrito. I asked the very nice waiter to add onions. The wife had a fajita burrito. My fundido chicken burrito had barely any flavor to it. Full of chicken with a few onions smothered in cheese and a white cheese sauce. Again with all that there was no flavor. Wife's fajita burrito was full of meat and veg but had a sweet taste to it Nothing like fajitas should taste. The waiter was a very nice young man who was very attentive. I'm doubting we will go back there again, which is sad because there aren't any good restaurants way out on this side of town."
Tiffany Nathan is a skanky server here that will give her phone number to any hot guys that come in She's thirsty for cock. Tiffany Nathan loves giving her number out 813-402-6683. Call for a good time and you'll get some world famous buffalo wings to eat with the skank wad too! 813-402-6683. She loves all cock.
"First time at Ruth's Chris, VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Portions were very small, it was expensive, the service was slow, and the food was not as GREAT as advertised!!! Come ON!! I know things tough right now."
"We walked in at 7:20, hours posted said till 8pm. They decided they were gunna close early, which is totally fine, BUT they didn't tell us when we got there. They waited till we sat down and started eating before the manager said that we needed to get out. They should've told us the minute we walked in, ""Hey we are closing early, all orders are to go only."" But they didn't and when my husband said, ""why didn't you tell us when we got in here."" The manager got really aggressive and raised his voice and said rudely, ""do you want to stay here another HOUR."" All in front of my 6 month old. All we wanted to do was finish our sandwiches. Won't be coming here again and don't recommend it. Blaze is right down the road and much better!"
Not good. Service was OK but the food abysmal. The best thing was the salad. Fried rice had no taste. The filet was basic. Veggies a no go. Just not good overall. Buyer beware. Pretty bad.
i waited about an hour for a table when i was told the wait was 20 minutes sat down my appatizer came out with my food my shrimp was completely raw as well as my dads fish the lighting was so dim he had ate about half of his fish and when he told the waiter she said oh it's fine and laughed it off he was brought a new plate they took my whole plate which included shrimp steak mashed patatos and broccoli to the back not once but twice and then brought out the same plate they remade my shrimp it came out raw again for the second time and when i asked to speak to the manger she said she would comp my meal threw away my food and didn't ask if she could remake it when i asked her to remake my food my waiter had brought it out and said here's your lunch for tommrow and rolled her eyes mind you i was in this restaurant for about two hours and all i had so far was bread and a bite of raw shrimp
If I could give a 0 I would. Don't go for lunch. It will make you sick. I've read other reviews that have said the staff doesn't pay workers fairly and I will not support a business who doesn't take care of their staff.
Bait and switch. Beware. Ordered a lunch from online menu. When I picked it up prices were higher by 20%. No recourse. Unethical.
"Bad customer service we walked up to the register and the lady was on her phone didn't greet us we waited for her to get off her phone to help us then as I was ordering a steak the lady was very rude and talking about other customers ordering, the place is very dirty not a pleasant visit"
This place is DISGUSTING. Not only have they been shut down for bad health conditions and accused of treating their employees like trash and not cleaning anything. They decided to put up politics on their sign which is not good business. Very disgusting and gross. This place needs to be shut down for good.
"Expensive, poor service, and food not great. Our bill was over $100 for 4 people. 1 Beer and no other drinks. Only 1 chip basket per table, but we had a large party and would only give 4 baskets. Our server never filled our drinks and was charged a mandatory gratuity."
I ordered a delivery order. I received my order confirmation via email. I began tracking my order and for 40 minutes my order stayed on prep. Over an hour later I received a call saying they were canceling my order because the driver left at 8 and I put my order in after 8. I will never order from this dominos again.
Chicken was gross had no flavor. Rice tasted old and cold spent 50.00 what a wast of money this place is horrible
"Pizza and calzone just isn't very good. Whatever you do, don't go there to pick it up! I've lived in plenty of truly dangerous places in my lifetime, but I can't think any situation in which I was more certain of impending robbery, carjacking, or getting shot than waiting in that parking lot for our order to get done! Seriously!"
"I have been a loyal customer of starbucks for a few years, and over the past year alone I visited starbucks at least 4x every week. I have always been satisfied with my order and the amount of time it took to prepare, however, I am extremely disappointed with their service in the course of the past few months. The store hours have been decimated so much that it is almost impossible to get in there once a week. I have made many phone calls asking for the new store hours but i get different answer every time. The website has not been updated and myself as well as a few others have tried to be flexible and come by when we can, but it is almost always closed. I'm not sure if this is due to short staffing or covid, but you are losing customers and money. Please take into consideration everything i have said. Thank you."
"Ordered three items. One showed up when driver came the first time. They offered me a 2L soda. Don't drink soda. The quality of food was not there. Horrible pizza, horrible wings, but mostly just non-existent customer service. $30. We are two wings out of each order and two slices. Had to throw everything away."
We ordered take out and were told it would be 30 min. We sat and waited for an additional 30 minutes because it wasn't ready. The food is good but not worth the inconvenience and wait. Will not be returning.
Horrible leadership for a small business. The management is very unprofessional. This business will never succeed with management who power trip. Team work would be more successful!!!
"This is the worst time I've had here. We had an 8PM reservation for 15 but was not seated until 8:30 PM. After being seated for 30 min, our drink orders were finally taken. 30 min after that appetizer orders were taken. 45 min after that entree orders were taken. We asked several times for the manager and he never came. Finally the guest of honor went to the bar where the manager was located but he was brash with her. After asking again for the manger at the table because the entree orders took an hour and a half to come out. When the manager came to the table he was brash yet again. No apology was ever offered. To his credit, Langston was doing as best he could to serve the table but he was only one person with little to no help. Every with the understanding of the impact of Covid, preparations should have been taken for a pasty of this size with advance reservations. Additionally, a simple apology from the manager instead of an unprofessional response would have gone a long way."
Pretty sure I got food poisoning from expired cabbage in the chow mein 2 days ago. Should have trusted my nose.
"VERY racist & rude. If you're African American, do yourself a favor and go to other nearby Latino eateries. They treat other Latino and white people fine, but they appear to not welcome black people here. Marelin P is such a rude and racist cashier!!!"
"I was looking forward to having a nice birthday dinner by treating myself to someplace better than average. I was seated right away (thanks to self seating). Someone brought water right away. The waiter took my order and brought me a drink. 45 minutes later I walked out. Having only had one soda. I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer to be followed by the Surf and Turf entree, I even upgraded to the Caesar Salad. I was going to top it of with the Crem Brulee. No food ever came to my table. No waiter approached my table again. Not even an offer to refill my drink. I was planning on leaving a decent tip on top of an expensive meal. Instead I left hungry. Worst dining experience I have ever had, not just in Reno. Do yourself a favor, go to Outback."
We stayed at the hotel next door and was looking for a late night pizza place and decided to give this place a try. We had a 10 inch pizza and an order of breadsticks. The breadsticks was ok but the pizza was not very tasteful. The workers at this place were not to welcoming either and seemed like they did not want to be there. Would not recommend to anyone.
They get my order wrong 90% of the time and they always seem grouchy and irritated that your making them work
They gave me a 55 minute time to be ready.im fine with that. Showed up 25-30 minutes later Charged me 20% of what I ordered for a service delivery fee. I tipped as well. Got Raw uncooked pizza not the right sauces and where is the cheese on any of that. Avoid at all cost. Just now got into my raw chicken and burnt dessert. Delivery was service was fine but I would've waited another 20 minutes for the quality of food I paid for and expected.
"I admit that I am typically too lazy to write reviews but I had such a poor experience today that I feel an obligation to warn others. I was in the city with my daughter today, had heard this place had just opened and thought it would be a fun late and light lunch and dessert. With all patience and acknowledgment of the difficulties right now - this was still a disaster. Service was slow and inattentive. Food was not great. I had to track down our server to find our missing food. I had to remind her to clear dishes so there was sufficient room to eat our desserts. The bathroom had no toilet paper or soap. Spare yourselves and wait until this place gets its act together."
"20 minutes never got an order, asked for money back which took another 15 minutes. If you are hungry and actually want food to eat.... go elsewhere. The one in Carson is 30x better and you drive thru it in 5 minutes tops. Also, it smells like a clogged toilet in there."
"Their food is okay, but their service is so awful, slow and rude that you will never want to go back. I live nearby and have given them at least 5 chances, just not worth it, there are tons of other lovely places Old City has to offer with wonderful ownership!"
"Wow. That was a bad chicken meal. I was the only person in the store and ordered an 8 pc dark plus fries, biscuits and mashed potatoes with gravy. After I paid I went to pick up my food. The chicken bag seemed light - after checking there was only 6 pcs. I told the worker and she gave me 2 more. I got home and discovered we received Mac n cheese instead of mashed potatoes. I hate this kind of carelessness. The fries were a soggy waste of money. I received 12 biscuits instead of 8. Thanks but no thanks. I'll go to Popeyes next time we want to splurge calories on fried chicken."
Fucking disgusting I got a bean and cheese chimi and side of rice to go never again if you can't get the beans right the rest is shit stars 0.5because the $1.75can soda was good and that didn't really come from them
"Came in with my wife yesterday excited to check it out. We were seated immediately by the young lady hostess. As there were only one other couple in the place we figured there would be next to no wait. We were wrong. One of the owners stood 10 feet away from us talking to a couple that had finished their meal. Apparently they knew each other or their families knew each other and they enjoyed their conversations. We were completely ignored for 10 minutes. This was extremely disappointing not only because we were hungry we were truly interested in having a new pizza place to frequent. To run a business successfully as an owner you need to be responsive to your customers! Ignoring people when no one else is in your restaurant will not produce positive results and unfortunately, we will not return."
"I hate to give a one star review, but this Wendy's location has been pure frustration to deal with; it is open completely random hours! Until last week I've had pretty good luck with weekday lunch. I arrived at 1:00 PM to find a crane hovering over the restaurant replacing an air conditioner. And of course they were closed. Conveniently there is a McDonalds two parking lots away, so I don't go hungry, but IMO Wendy's has far fresher tasting food. And before someone comes up with a pandemic / supply chain / hiring comment, the McDonalds 500 feet away is open their posted hours every day, no excuses. C'mon Wendy's, get your act together!"
Closed for construction and didn't notify Yelp or google - bad business - just walked 15 minutes to get here
The customer service is AWFUL! I leave in just as bad a mood as the employees. I love Cava but I think I'm gonna have to be done with this one. This time the associates were vocal they were ready to close. I got to the point where they add meat and they had ONE. They were not cooking anymore and judging by the fact the grill was cleaned way before I got there they didn't care. We weren't given an option for drinks and the card readers were broken. While eating we were all locked in with no one attending the door which is surely a fire hazard. We had to figure out how to unlock the door to get out. Maybe the Franklin location will be better.
"New Year's Day and weather was lousy and, as we were staying at the Dream Hotel, we availed ourselves of the on-site restaurant. Waitress was efficient and recommended the chef's special, prime rib, and served medium rare, as chef recommended. First attempt was well done, so I sent it back; second attempt was rarer but stone cold. When I pointed this out, the manager appeared and proceeded to school me on how prime rib is to be served cold. I know quite well how to cook beef medium rare and how to keep it warm and the manager's condescending manner did nothing to make the meat tasty. The side dishes were hot and delicious. My husband's prawn meal was good."
"We love the food but was so so disappointed last night! We chose it for dinner and they missed up our order, it was Uber delivery so it was hard to fix as it's the restaurant mistake."
"Stopped in for breakfast as the outside patio was completely empty. Was told it would take a little bit to find a server to work out there and take care of us. Waited for a while and then was told it would be ""probably 20 more minutes or longer"" before someone could serve us outside (another party was already seated outside too and had service). Really dumb."
"I came here for the comedy...and to vent a bit. If I could sit down with the owner for at least 5 mins and just hear the reason for the foolishness so it could all make sense. Honestly, I think I'm more interested with the magic of keeping a place open that makes little to no money when the employees clearly make more than what's on their paycheck. Straight"
"Total rip off- ordered M&M cookies and they called to say they were out of those so we wanted to cancel the order- but they told us they would add M&Ms to the sugar cookies. Long story short we pick up the cookies and NO M&Ms in the cookies. I called them and the person who answered (same person that called to tell us they were out the cookies) and said ""whoops, we were actually out of M&Ms. I should've called you back."" But of course they didn't because they didn't want to lose the sale. Well you've lost a customer. Grow up and run your business like a professional."
"Sat at the bar and our server was extremely flirtatious with my fiancé. I'd understand if we went to hooters or another restaurant where you go for the girls, but we did not go for the girls. she got my drink order wrong 3 times, forgot my side when our food came out, and brought him silverware but not me. super attentive to my fiancé. and he wasn't even the one that paid!!! the bar was also littered with drinks from previous guests and had definitely not been wiped down."
"The food used to be good.We've tried to give it few more tries, hoping it'll be at least decent tasting. This last visit was definitely the reason we won't be back. When we're seated, no one said anything. No welcome, here's the menu, waters? Nothing. 10 min later, a girl brought chips and salsa and said nothing and walked away. Another 10 min, our waiter comes up with menus, sets them down doesn't say a name and just says drinks. We didn't get a drink menu and had literally just received the regular menus. Which have changed every time we've been here. We ordered and got our food really fast. Not even 20 min. But the food orders were wrong and cold. We paid our bill and left."
"Waited forever, Never got our food. The manager kindly said ""I'll take it off the bill"" Well thanks since we never got it...sub par service. The couple next to us nearly walked out for same reason. Trust me, skip this place. Terrible experience all around"
"I ordered a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. When i got my pizza, i bit into it to realize that under the cheese on the only cheese side there was pepperoni. I do not eat meat so this was a big deal. Seemed like someone didn't realize it was half cheese and tried to cover the mistake with cheese. When we called, the manager immediately told us we ordered all pepperoni with extra cheese. I have proof this was wrong. He argued with us when i asked if it was all pepperoni why was half covered with cheese? Seems there's something wrong almost every time i order here as this is not a first."
"Over priced Mexican food and they make sure to purposely make your food incorrect to steal from you. My husband ordered me the pambazo with steak meat and there was no steak meat! Slow service and not a friendly place to give your business to. If you do decide to try this place make sure to unwrapped your food and make sure your food is made correctly, but if you have to go through all that trouble, then my best suggestions is to avoid this place at all cost. I would NOT RECOMMEND! there's better Mexican restaurant out here in Reno."
"Walked in and immediately a younger lady with glasses approached vigorously. We walked over to her and simply asked her about the packages and she had an attitude the whole time. At that point, We decided to leave. Very rude customer service. Find workers that will actually treat customers well. Do better. Dog shit"
i'm actually so disappointed speaking of the fact wawa never lets me down. they didn't have chicken for my quesadilla or roasted veggies and they made me pay before they wanted to tell me they had nothing i wanted and wouldn't give me a refund. get it together.
"I was given an offer for a free medium 2 topping pizza from dominos but they would not let me order it because it didn't reach the ""minimum delivery price of $17"". So it's essentially an empty offer. Why even tell people that then? What the point? Just reeks of laziness."
He ordered his steak medium well and it came out bloody and smelled sour.. but I loved the passive aggressive response so thank you
"I ordered out and was missing half my order including the 2 sauces. And the French fries were awful. They were hard and cold. After it taking them 2 hours to even get it done. As they were trying to resolve it i was on hold for 45 mins waiting for a manger, so I hung up called back because they completely forgot I was on hold. So all in all not a great experience."
"We have tried this restaurant three times and really wanted to like it as we live close by in Bryn Mawr. The food is average at best and the interior decor is as budget as it gets. The service at the table has always been friendly, but slow which I would actually enjoy if it were a good Italian restaurant. However, the biggest turnoff is the extremely rude (all three times now) hostess that makes you feel you need to leave immediately after eating even when the restaurant is 80% empty. I love that this location is a restaurant over the old Wells Fargo bank, but I hate to say I hope this place closes and another establishment of better quality takes its place."
"Garbage service, they received my order but did not follow through with making and delivering it after they confirmed the order."
God this place was disgusting. The soup tasted like straight up dish soap and ruined my appetite and made me sick. Don't go here.
"Went here 1 hr before my flight thinking I had plenty of time. I was seated at a table and waited 20 minutes with no one coming to take my order. A family came and sat 3 tables down and got their order taken within 5 minutes and then the server walked the opposite direction from me. I went to the bar to approach the server and asked why they didn't take my order. They said my table was not assigned a server. She said she would get my order shortly. About a minute later the same host who sat me, Bryan, came and asked if I just walked in and sat myself. I responded you sat me here twenty minutes ago! About a minute later a nice server, Erika, came and took the order and got it done. I wonder how long I would have had to sit there with no response from someone because the host, Bryan, doesn't know how to do the most important part of his job...seat people. Erika, our server finally, was great. Bryan not so much."
Just like Hamilton stated below...they're still on that mask mandate mess but I wouldn't even have been upset if the staff wasn't so freakin rude about it! On top of that they didn't even have any mask to offer customers smh Literally embarrassing unprofessional and rude! Never again! ....and shoutout to Hip City Veg next door!they'll see me again.
"Very disappointed went there over there over the weekend and order pho ga when they handed me my bowl I found A bug in my bowl, told the guy I want A net one ending up the new bowl wasn't good at all very disappointed"
Had to wait 45 minutes for a cappuccino. The staff were sweet but to wait that long for coffee is ridiculous
"went through, line was slow as usual but nothing crazy. our total was $10 we got a mac & cheese and a chicken sandwich. we paid and the person that took our money closed the window and left to get our food. then this girl begrudgingly open the window and told us we owed $31. i said ""no we actually just paid you're mistaken"" and she closed the window. we finally got our food, i open my LARGE mac n cheese, and it was filled, i kid you not, just above the cups half way point. i was genuinely shocked when i saw that, because to me, you wouldn't fill a large that low unless it was on purpose.. and if these employees are taking out their frustrations on the customers then this place is not going to last. i'll definitely never visit this location again. you just lost a customer popeyes. picture attached to review is right after i opened the lid. half empty. rude as hell. i'm pissed."
The 5 times I have been there.... I have never seen everything available. Something is always out. One time they had no chicken. Another time no peppers. This time 2 sodas in the machine were out. The silverware was out. And every employee was chatting in back and no one was up front. No hustle or lack of care. Line is to the door. They need more staff and more product.
"I went to get a vanilla cream cold brew and asked for the 20 ounce and was basically told I wasn't allowed to get it. It was under cold brew and the lady was rude to me and said ""it's a specialty drink and only comes in one size"". I pointed to where it was on the menu in the store where it is listed to come in 2 different sizes and she still refused to give me what is displayed in their store. The ounces are not an issue for me it was just the way it was handled and how it is displayed. It should be covered so that it is not confusing for the customers. I also looked in the app to see if maybe the location just had the wrong information and you are able to pick either size. Not sure what the issue is but it needed to be addressed."
"The female bartender on nye underestimated us, she made my friends feel like we were below it and that we weren't worth her time. Literal conversation ""what dressings do you have"" ""they're house made you wouldn't know how they taste"" OKAY THEN DESCRIBE THEM YA FREAK she was quite literally the worst don't go there unless you feel like getting degraded"
"Slow service, clueless managers, greasy food, dirty plates and not to mention the place itself is dirty. Sad attempt at an upscale restaurant"
What happened to this place ????? Pizza use to be good when I first moved to Florida from up north ... came back and I would rather go buy little ceasers for $5 instead .. nasty pizza even the coke from the soda machine rates like trash .. place looks dirty as well !! YOUVE VEEN WARNED
"We were looking for top rated Italian restaurants in the area and Alfano's was at the top. Was concerned with a number of very low ratings, and there were also good ones- so a mixed bag, but tried it last night. There was a sparse attendance; about a third of the tables were occupied. Ordered wedding soup, which was pretty good and quick. No wait for our seats, but a 40 minute wait for the two entrees - veal Milanese and chicken Marsala. Several apologies from the wait staff that they were very busy. The veal was good; the chicken tasteless and the pasta sauce tasted odd. So a very mixed meal opinion.....just like the reviews. If you go, I hope you can write a good review, but beware. One star for the meal issues vs the price."
"I was debating on whether to post this but here goes. My hubby I and my granddaughter went here about 5 weeks ago. We went in & it was very crowded. Lots of people sitting at the bar and we were told it would be atleast a half hour. We decided to wait and the hostess came over to tell us she had a booth ,we only waited maybe 20 minutes. We walked over to the booth and as we were going to sit down this huge roach was crawling up the wall over the table. The hostess backed up and was kind of freaking. I said are you going to kill it...she backed up farther and said no way and I touching that. I took my menu and swatted it. At that point I had no idea where it was and really in disbelief that she was doing nothing about it. She just looked at us and said I guess you don't want to stay. Now I get that you are going to have some bugs but as we left I saw the hostess go into the other dining room. Maybe I should have stayed and asked to speak to the manager or owner but it was so crowded I just didn't want to be so close to all the people without masks during covid. Needless to say we won't be going back there."
"This is about the third time this is happened to me. I purchased the Coffee deal where I can get multiple coffees for a fixed price per month. I was using Panera as my study location as I am going to school for medical. When I get to location, the inside dining is closed and the line is wrapped around the building. If it was because of Covid, it would not be open intermittently, I was here yesterday and was able to go inside and order and sit and study, but today it is closed and earlier this week was the same situation. Very frustrating."
"I am truly confused as to why this establishment is so highly rated. It's as if the crowd here is not familiar with authentic poke'. We tried 'The Ring of Fire' and 'The OG', both of which were bland with the exception of the blistered pepper. The rice was cold mush and consumed about 80% of the bowl. Please try Poke' Hana in Orlando if you would like a comparison of the night and day difference between flavorful, marinated fresh Hawaiian poke' and accompaniments."
"The music here is usually too boring. I happened to stop by last night and the vibe was actually cool and I was having a good time, but it seemed the DJ was only allowed a short set before it went back to the most horrendous basic music ever."
"Sorry the reviews were really good so we thought we would give it a try. Sunday afternoon bad choice, we ordered 4 burgers. We waited over an hour and they were NOT amazing. They were hot but not special. Save your money, because it wasn't cheap and go to Burger Monger. Better burgers."
"Very unprofessional. The employee who took my order seemed annoyed the whole time and in the end got my order wrong. As well as, the environment was very negligent, so much as to the employees were wearing beanies while inside which subtracts from the overall chick-Fil-A experience. I would highly recommend the Chick-Fil-A on Franklin road instead!"
"Ordered take out, kind of hard to mess up. My wings were cold. And despite being freshly made.... Also how do you order the special of 10boneless wings + fries, be charged for it. And don't get the french fries? While I was waiting for my food in the takeout area a Waitress came out of the kitchen, and yelled to a table waaaaaayyy on the other side of the dine in area ""hey your food is almost done baby!"" That was super weird. my wife tried to use the bathroom, she said there was a bloody tampon on one of the 3 stalls, the 2nd stall was clogged, and the 3rd stall someone was using. I didn't know a franchise could be this bad from one to the next."
"After unprofessional rude behavior.... After pointing out the rudeness, a worker with dreads threatened to hit me and charged at me out the side door. The manager Fagan also made threats and began to lie to cover up his and his worker's behavior"
"I placed an order through Uber eats for a family that had covid. 25 minutes after posting the order, cafe Zupas cancelled it. The family has been waiting on that order. Very unprofessional and disappointed. This is not my first bad experience with them either, but it will be my last."
"I would give this place a -10 if they had it. It was the worse food I have ever had. The noodles were pasty, the vegetables were cold, and the Seasame Chicken tasty like oil, no sesame flavor and the chicken tasted sour (bad). I went to complain and they refused to give me my money back and they caused a big scene. I posted on Facebook and over 50 people so far had something terrible to say about this place. Do not eat here"
There has been multiple times I've come here and I've had the workers say they are closed when they lights are on and workers are clearly here. Now they are clearly they are taking their time. They should find some workers that actually want to work.
"Was excited to try Homage for some time now. Unfortunately didn't get to, walked right out shortly after entering. terrible customer service"
"I think this may be a scam restaurant. Could not find a menu online anywhere, even on their website. We finally found a picture of a menu on yelp I believe, and then when we called to place a to go order... things got weird. I said I wanted the oatmeal parfait... she said they don't have that. I said I wanted a croissant and they said they didn't have that either. ""Maybe you're looking at the wrong menu?"". Okay, so I asked her where to find a menu and she seemed confused. She said ""I can tell you what we have, pancakes eggs bacon fruit"". Ending up ordering some stuff because at this point we were desperate to eat and we're so confused. Picked it up and they forgot a bunch of stuff and the food wasn't even good. I think we got scammed."
"I usually order from banana leaf 2-3x a month and Ive never had a problem until yesterday. I ordered the Indian Mee Goreng and I got food poisoning. The dish was poorly cooked and the shrimp was on the raw side and 20-30 minutes after eating, I ended up throwing up for 3 hours. I would not recommend ordering from Banana Leaf, this was a horrible experience."
We booked this for NYE and it was terrible! The ship never left port and no fireworks due to foggy weather but there was never an announcement. The DJ announced midnight was approaching but never did a countdown ! Worst of all I received a response back from Jill that basically called me liar and said several announcements were made and DJ did countdown. I guess we were on two separate yachts ! She offered me $50 to compensate our $600 wasted expense. Not worth it.
"Took forever for the food, pushy employees with attitudes. Literally sat in this establishment for an hour while everyone got served before us. Don't recommend the energy of this place at all."
"Took 30 minutes for 2 double stack burgers and a frosty. The guy at the counter looked lost and the people in line, waited there for 20 minutes before ever getting helped. They all looked lost as ever can be. Tables were dirty, floor was disgusting."
"The only reason I am giving this place one star is due to the kindness of the staff. I have lived all over this country and have been all around the world, and this is BY FAR the WORST Americanized Chinese food I have ever put into my mouth. With that said, I am not sure who is writing these reviews giving this place over 4 stars because the food was INEDIBLE. I threw it all out without eating more than a few bites. It had almost no taste. And what taste it did have, was BAD. The General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken were bland and tasted EXACTLY the same. But the worst part was the Mongolian Beef. It tasted BAD. And when I say BAD...I mean bad like something was rotten, moldy, etc."
"This is one of our favorite restaurants to come to in St Pete! It legitimately is a place that we would come to if we were traveling down 75 South. Long Way in as most know. Unfortunately, they're doing you a favor basically by serving you. No thank you. Their food is absolutely incredible, but for the service itself, I wouldn't waste my time. Daytime has been a completely different experience. Daytime servers apparently care more,, I guess!"
"Went in to place an order. No one working there was wearing a mask. Asked if the people making the food wore masks. The kid said ""yeah we have masks."" Walked out. They don't care about keeping their customers safe. Should not be in the service business. I've been there before and liked their food but clearly never going back again. Check out all the other ""not recommended"" and reported reviews on the same issue that have been hidden for their rating."
I'd give it zero stars if that was an option. That skinny little Brandon supporting twerp needs to work on his social skills
"I went into Ihop and my son who is 15 went to use the restroom and had come and told me there was no soap so we asked if they had any and my son had said ""washing your hands is important"" jokingly and I kid you not the lady then proceeded to say "" especially after you touched your penis"". I find the behavior very unprofessional and inappropriate, this remark was not needed to be said and made us feel very uncomfortable which we then proceeded to leave. I will not be going back to this IHOP ever again and I wish I had gotten her name as I would report her to the manager"
I don't normally stop into McDonald's but decided I would today to get the apps .99 cent iced coffee! I even add on a sandwich too. I did a mobile order thinking it would be faster and easier as I have work this morning. I was pulled all the way through window 3 outside. I waited for 15 minutes at this window as cars outside kept passing me. Finally someone came to the window and said her computer crashed - no biggie. Showed her my phone that I paid. Then she came back and asked me to pay more than what I was supposed to pay via the app. Then some other woman came and told me I had to pay more and that the app crashed - even though I was charged. And kept saying the man said you need to pay. So I told her to cancel my order and left. On to bigger and better things like Wendy's or Starbucks for morning coffee (:
"At the height of the Omicron surge, Wendy's DOES NOT REQUIRE THEIR FOOD HANDLER EMPLOYEES TO WEAR MASKS! This is the height of corporate irresponsibility and lack of caring for their customers as well as their employees. Not going there any time soon and suggest you consider this wreckless no-health policy before you take a bite. If they can't be bothered, then neither can I."
"Came here a couple of years ago and I thought it was ok. This time I got a skillet. The name of this place shouldn't be called BIG BAD BREAKFAST it should be called SMALL WEAK BREAKFAST. My wife got the french toast and it was good. She also got a side of scrambled eggs. My skillet was cold as were her eggs. Her eggs had a crust on top like they've been sitting for a while. If I'm paying $11 for a breakfast I expect it to be warm and more than 4 bites. Don't waste your time. Like I said, ""This breakfast is not 'BIG' but is 'BAD."
My wife and I ate there last night! When we got there they greeted us and were very friendly. We ordered and the food arrived very quickly. I ordered a half rack of ribs and my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was cold and the meat was very dry. My ribs smelled great but that's where it ended! The ribs were cold when they arrived but I tried to eat them anyway! The ribs were extremely tough and difficult to cut apart with the plastic knife they gave us! The best part of the meal were the baked beans and the fresh cole slaw. If you eat there it is at your own risk!!
"I just walked out, they have a sign announcing their employee shortage, but after waiting for very long time and looking at some of the employees walking back and ford doing nothing and the manager or supervisor having a pleasant conversation with another employee ignoring all the people were waiting to be seating in a very empty restaurant made me wonder about their food quality..."
"Didn't really enjoy the filet mignon pho bowl the broth isn't very good it taste so weird idk I can't explain it, I had high hopes I tried to finish it and couldn't even finish it! They need to switch there whole broth recipe"
"Saw this on list of top restaurants to eat at. Coming from Texas .... Definitely would not recommend. Service was not good, gravy was cold and not well mixed. Waitress brought our food to the wrong table let the people touch it then tried to bring it directly to our table. Not sure what to say besides. Don't eat here"
"The menu looked good. But sat there for 20 mins no one checked on us, asked drinks, nothing. They sat 2 other couples behinds of us And server them So just left. Probably will be back. But just left and didn't even stop us. Was looking forward to trying but not anymore."
The management team need to train the employee better how to read the computer screen staff are not friendly parking lot is dirty.
"Almost everyone we encountered from the hostess to restaurant staff as well as bar staff were not wearing masks. I requested our waitress to wear a mask which she did, but it was obvious she thought i was in the wrong. Even the kitchen staff was maskless. Seriously, are you stupid or just stupid republicans? There is a pandemic and it is not over! I had read that masking was now required indoors in Pima County, and that was certainly the case at many of the places I have been to on this trip. And, I know for some this is a political issue, but dining out right now for me is a health concern, so it was bizarre to be in a restaurant and seeing most everyone unmasked, including 95% of the staff. This was a business dinner so I couldnt really back out, but if I was alone I would just flat out not eat there. To the owners of this restaurant: customers will rememebr who followed the rules and the right thing and who didnt, and vote with our pocketbooks! Oh yeah, the food was ""meh"" and dinner for two was $190 with tip."
"Um, if you're not white, stay away. We walked in and the old hostess rudely and nastily told us its reservations ONLY and waved us off and started to greet the people behind us--who were white of course--with courtesy and politeness. To us there was no hello, do you have a reservation, sorry but. There were people in front of us and behind us she talk to them with a completely different attitude. And yes, of course they were all white. It's a cute cute town with lots of other eating options. But if you're not white and still want to subject yourself to this treatment by eating here, then make sure that (1) you don't have an accent because she'll probably tell you that the reservation is full, and (2) make sure you use a white name. Good luck."
This Taco Bell has been trash. I'm ok with the time i have to waste to get food from here. But my overall experience has been far from satisfactory! Even I though I wait longer then I think is necessary... they have never got my order right. Now I have a new problem:.. and it's the fact that they've been closing before 2. When I was told by a manager... they close at 3. My overall review of this place will be trash. . Never will I expect anything less then half ass from this low level of a Taco Bell. Fix you're shit Taco Bell company !
"The WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my ENTIRE life. I came here two separate occasions, both at 7:50 pm on two separate Tuesday evenings. El Paseo advertises that they are open until 9pm, however BOTH of these times they denied me from their restaurant during their ""open hours"". The first time because they had a ""special event"" going on, which they failed to disclose on their website, and the second time, because they decided to close at 8pm that day, without any notice. The most recent time, I took a 45 minute Uber to the restaurant only to be greeted by the rudest hostess I have ever met in my entire life. She told me they decided to close early because they didn't have enough business that particular day, and after telling her I had just spent $70 ubering there and that they still had an hour and 15 minutes until closing, as mentioned on their website, she told me thats ""too bad"" and I should find somewhere else to eat, and then proceeded to slam the door in my face. I will never be returning to this restaurant EVER again, and I highly advise that you take your money and time and spend it at a small local restaurant in Downtown SB, where there is plenty of delicious food and small local businesss that actually WANT, and need, your customer service."
"Very bad customer service. Everything was unprofessional. Charge us more than they should, after pointing it out they did not want to return the money or somehow compensate. They put the dessert not the one we ordered. I do not recommend this place."
"I came here within two a week or two of it opening, and unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I came on a Friday night with 3 friends. I ordered a cocktail and a burger and fries. Our food took a very long time and my fries were completely unseasoned and my burger was somewhat undercooked (I ask for ""medium""). The prices weren't extremely high, but certainly too high for what we got. I'll cut them some slack because the restaurant was brand new when I went there, so maybe it's better now. But I don't plan on going back."
"This is a good spot to work, but the least they could do is keep their hours UPDATED on the OCF website. I checked online before showing, up for it to be CLOSED."
"Unpleasant service. Ordered 3 sandwich's and was told ""we gave you hot sauce"" when we were given a tiny container of hot sauce on the side. (No utensils for potato's, no ketchup, forgot to give card back)"
Good is so inconsistent that we have stopped going. We have been there 4 times and for the price and the inconsistency it's definitely not worth it. We rather go to Crave or Coynes for less money and better quality food and service.
Food is alright. I've sworn off this truck for life after I asked for sriracha and was told I had to pay extra for sauce.
"Great place for drinks. Wouldn't recommend the food. Went here for date night after reading online reviews. Ordered the creamed spinach app, it was pretty bland, but ok. We decided we were both in the mood for steak. Ordered medium, rec'd well done. Came with greasy unsalted potatoes and crispy fresh steamed broccoli with grated parm cheese. Husband subbed for fries and they were limp and white. I was super excited to have a nice restaurant close by and was totally let down. For $150+ for one round of drinks and dinner I expected just a little more. However my Bloody Mary was great!!!"
"Food was decent but the service was horrible. Coffee was cold, our food was cold. Server was not attentive until the end. Management did not care when feedback was given. Not a good experience overall."
"I drove 45 minutes to this restaurant just to dine in a greenhouse with some friends. I was sure I had reserved one online, but apparently it didn't go through correctly. The taller hostess was incredibly rude about it and said that the greenhouse wasn't in my reservation and they were completely booked. Well, we went into the (very cold) enclosed patio and I watched 4 of the greenhouses stay empty the entire time we were there. I will say that our waitress was very pleasant. 4/5 cheeses from the cheese board were pretty good but the unpasteurized one from Vermont was just plain awful. I wasn't really a fan of the octopus to be honest, even though apparently is popular. The white mash that accompanied the salmon had an overpowering coconut flavor. I had really high hopes for this place and made such a long drive in the freezing cold to safely enjoy an nice evening with friends in the middle of a surge, only to be ruined by a millennial snowflake."
"Very disappointed. My partner tried the sushi a few weeks ago and loved it so we decided to try the Thai food tonight. The chicken was dry, flavorless and tasted a few days old. It honestly tasted like they batch cooked a bunch of the chicken at the beginning of the week and then topped the meal with that protein instead of making the chicken fresh with the meal."
"Food was good. Service poor.got the 20 oz. Ribeye. Waitress said she would bring bread out as we were waiting for our food. She never did. I flagged down a waiter about the bread and ketchup. He brought both out. 5 min.later our waitress asked if everything was ok. I said ""yes, now that we have our bread and ketchup. She was unfazed and unapologetic. I then remembered she never told us her name since I was planning on talking to the manager about our poor service. I had asked her when we got our food if they do a small dessert for Birthdays. She said ""Yes, I got you covered"" After we were done she brought the check there was no mention or sign of the Birthday Dessert. She came back for the card and returned receipt for my signature wishing us a Happy New Year. No bread no ketchup no BIRTHDAY Dessert from her! Horrible unacceptable service!! No Tip!!"
Although the food is good especially the paella their ultimate margarita is disgusting. ..all I could taste was lime and lime juice.......No alcohol. I ordered a shot of patron to go with it. To the management. If you're going to charge $11 for a drink make sure you train your bartender how to make it. PROPERLY. Send one of your flunkies to Vallartas. to take notes on how to make this beautiful Mexican cocktail. ..
"I usually try to only post positive reviews... but this place just continues to go down hill and I'm hoping reviews like mine might serve as a catalyst for them to improve their business. We used to go here often. It was convenient and yummy. But it seems to get dirtier and dirtier every time we're there. Yesterday there was a cloud of flies swarming around in the middle of the dining room. It was gross! I understand that businesses are experiencing staffing issues, so maybe there's a learning curve involved, but the sushi was sub-par. The cooked rolls were over-cooked and caked in batter. (The server himself was very nice and attentive though!) The restrooms never seem very clean, either. Unfortunately, we won't be returning anytime soon."
"The reviews warned us... This is somehow a sub-par bonchon. But we went nevertheless. And were met with a sub-par experience. We only ordered one small dish and the waitress seemed a lil judgey (""are you SURE?"") and the fried chicken that came (super quickly) was only 60% coated with sauce. Sad. Both my partner and I proceeded to GI problems that night, our stomachs were not too happy with our choice of dinner that day."
"They have the worst Brussels sprouts I have ever had!!! they look like scrapings from the bottom of the pan at first I thought it was just the one in Cherry Hill that served those nasty things but that is just who they are there menu And the edamame was very bland and also cold the veggie burger was cold and not prepared the way I asked smh I asked for fried onions lettuce tomato ketchup, in stead J got raw onion and cabbage are you kidding me I don't have a pic of the burger because that was two weeks ago and I figured I'd give it another go"
"Atmosphere is really cute, which it needs to be while you wait twenty minutes for your hot drink. Despite having 5 staff, only one person actually seemed to be doing anything? My hot chai latte was lukewarm at best, and the scone was so gross - like mealy and tasted like baking soda. Also, they don't have a mask requirement so nobody but staff was wearing masks."
"Don't waste your time, I've never left a review before but this was bad enough to get me to. Ordered off Uber eats, order took an extra 45 min from estimated time to even leave the store. Got some chicken dumplings, bao buns, and Kung pao bowl. The bao buns were not even the ones I ordered, and the ones they sent were very bland and disappointing. The bowl may have been slightly better if it actually was just a frozen meal. It was just mush on top of rice. I will say the dumplings were decent, I just wish I had read the other Yelp reviews before ordering."
"What is going on here??!!!! Twice this weekend we ate here, twice the food was terrible!! My steak last night WAS excellent. No issue there. However, the pork chop both time was way over cooked and the halibut was cold. Service was slow last night. It took 2 hrs for our meal. My Caesar salad that I get every time was awful. When we told our server the halibut was cold and the pork chop was well done she offered us a piece of cake. Okkk we get our food comped usually by the hotel but if I was a paying customer I'd be pissed spending $400 on dinner for it to be this inconsistent and poor quality. 2 stars for the steak being great"
"Came here for Nashville Food Fights wings month to get a free 6 piece. Ordered perfectly awesome with a side of baked beans and Mac and cheese. I was expecting fried wings with a medium hot sauce. Turns out they were smoked wings and all their sauces were just different bbq sauces. I have had really great smoked wings before, and these just completely missed the mark for me. I also don't care for bbq sauce on wings, so I'm a little biased on that part. If you love smoked bbq wings, you may still like this place. But for me, it's a hard pass. On to the sides... baked beans were okay. Hard to really mess up baked beans. They're sweet and have little bits of pulled chicken in them. Nothing special, not bad. Just average. Mac and cheese on the other hand was just awful. They put bacon on their Mac and cheese and the bacon was the only thing that had any flavor. The Mac and cheese itself was dry and lacking big time in flavor. I think this place may have other things worth trying, but I wasn't impressed enough with anything to want to return here in the future."
"Ordered from Uber. Missing more than 50% of my food order. Delivered in what looks like a used Wing House bag unsealed. Big disappointment. Didn't want to chance it with the unsealed bag, but on the flip side the burger smelled and looked great."
"I'm starting to think it's me because all of these high rated restaurants I've been trying have been a major letdown. The pizza was ok. I would have been happier with Pizza Hut. Like other reviews, I agree that the pizza has hardly any sauce and I think that's the main missing ingredient. I wouldn't feel the need to stop here again"
"I opted for the Savoury Belgian Waffle - 21$ 2 poached eggs, scratch made hollandaise, Belgium waffle, roasted potatoes & 2 chicken honey sausages. . I can't say I was impressed with this meal. It wasn't super hot and the waffle was bland. My cuisinart and a quick trip next door to blush lane would have served me better. . The place is nice and intimate, but I didn't particularly enjoy the food and it felt like we were being shooed out after only 45 minutes of being there. . The quality was fresh, but the portion and flavors weren't there for me. . Presentation is nice though. . Overall don't foresee myself coming back and surprised so many recommend it."
"Was kinda average.. idk what else to say. The pastries was filled with air, not what they were supposed to be filled with. Definitely not french. I'm going to acme bakery now to satisfy my sweet tooth"
"This was our second visit to Currents and while we enjoyed our first visit, although we couldn't eat the lobster bisque because it was extremely salty, we were very disappointed with our second visit. I had the Redfish with the crab and I literally had to use my knife to cut the fish. It was definitely overdone and very dry. I don't mind paying $38.00 for a meal, but it better be good. Not sure if we will go back."
I had high expectations based on their reputation. The food came out cold but the quality made up for it. My biggest issue is that the waiter took our order and didn't return until we were almost done our entrees. He then made a complaint to us that we ordered a drink from another waiter because we couldn't find him. I can't see me returning for this type of experience.
"This place has changed for the worse just like it's sister restaurant Waterside grill They share kitchens in this Marriott Water Street Hotel that use to be my favorite The staff are all new, or borrowed from the shared kitchen, says the staff themselves No one knows the menu No one can answer questions Gluten free items stink here Not a good place for vegetarians either Came when it is usually packed, but I was surprised upon sitting that it was empty for dinner There was an odd buffet set up in the middle past the bar, it was active and hot but no one said anything about it and it was not in the menu My visit was short but not sweet"
"100% tourist trap smallest portions I've ever had in New Orleans and my entire life didn't have bold bursting flavors. I just wanted to try something that I know tourists eat at the gumbo shop is a waste of time if you're in New Orleans, but I stopped in tried it. Just keep walking right past it The only thing that was good was the bread which all the bread New Orleans was good"
"So surprised by the great reviews. The food was so below average. Meats were just okay. Cold ribs and brisket were alright, tender. Brisket rub was nice. Brisket is fatty, which is normal but this was mostly fat. Ribs did fall of the bone. Tasted that smoke into the next day which is indicative of poor fire/wood management. Fries were awful. Way over and sorta soggy. Mac and cheese was watery with a slob of useless melted cheese on top. Bbq sauce was very sweet. I would not come back here. The place decor, seating, and service was nice. But it's cold inside in the winter."
"I didn't like most of the food, it was mostly bland and forgetful. The beignet fries were good, I'd eat those again."
"First time trying this restaurant, and it was poor customer service. It took forever to get my simple order. I had to ask the waitress, ""how much longer for my food"" and then she remember. For my order, ask if i could get chocolate chip pancakes, but instead, I got chocolate chips on top of my pancakes.... the food was okay, but I'm big on customer service."
"The sushi was very good but service in the restaurant was not. We did not get our whole order....we waited and waited for our two items that we ultimately never got. We were completely ignored and sat for 40 mins at the table. Tried to get their attention and finally asked for the check with the two items we never got taken off. We waited another 15-20mins before getting up and saying we were leaving and if they wanted us to pay they needed to give us the check. Took another 5 minutes and they had to ask us again what we didn't get so they could remove it from the bill. They brought the check then and left. Never said thank you or apologize for us not getting our food. Very disappointing, especially with all the past great reviews."
"Mixed up our order. Forgot one of the items. Gave us chicken by accident when we ordered beef. Mystery meat in the beef. They seemed disorganized with online orders. On the positive side, the fish was pretty good."
"Lisa Nelson 9 reviews·5 photos just nowNEW I'm not sure why this place gets 4.6 stars. 1. Very limited space, feeling claustrophobic. 2. Understaffed...? Food takes way too long to prepare, and even simple drinks like house sake take forever to serve. 3. Quite pricey, but it could be subjective. I'm sure most people feel it's worth it. It's good food but it's not worth the price. I don't think I'll visit again."
"this place was very cozy and had great customer service. Jim waited on us. the omelette i had was great but the avocado was missing and the fruit with it had mold on it. fiancées steak was ordered medium but it was definitely well done. overall, $54 (before tip) for our 2 meals & orange juice/ coffee, this place was not worth it."
I had ordered the asada tacos and they were not the best. the pieces were over cooked and tasted burnt. it was overall just kind of dry and the flavor of the steak was not very good either. The chips are amazing though.
I used to frequent this location a lot. But they changed something recently. The gyros do not taste the same and the potato salad taste like complete bland crap now. I don't know if they are cost cutting or what but I've been their Twice just to make sure it was just a bad day in the kitchen. No. Same bland food. Please undo whatever you guys did.
"We ordered kebabs and tikka masala. Kebabs looked boiled and not grilled. The tikka masala didn't taste like tikka masala, just tomato paste. Aside from the taste, it did not include rice and we had to pay separately, even though this dish normally is eaten and served with rice. I was hoping for a good hole in the wall place, but this wasn't it."
"My partner and I love a good breakfast place- unfortunately, the roost did not quite meet our standards. We came on a Saturday morning. Restaurant wasn't busy and staffed well. When we got seated we had to wait 10 mins for a server to come and take our drink order. Then, after our drinks, they didn't stop by for another 10 mins until we made that awkward, across the restaurant, eye contact letting them know we need something. My coffee tasted burnt and they didn't have any flavored creamers (how!). My partner ordered an iced tea that was 90% water and 10% tea. It was just a mess. As for the food: very average and very ""eh."" Our bacon was alittle over cooked, my over easy egg was almost completely cooked through... the only decent item was our French toast, but even that was very average. Long story short, we most likely wont go back. There's a lot of little things with easy fixes that can be made to make this place better."
This was the worst Kung Pao I've ever had. Only a couple pieces of super dry over cooked chicken with 1000 green onions (even the bottoms) and bamboo shoots with absolutely zero spice. How this is Kung Pao is beyond me.... Also ordered sweet and sour chicken which was fine but it comes with sauce already on it. My son wouldn't touch it. Wish it said this on the menu.
"I'm embarrassed to say I ate here in New Orleans. It was on our last day before a long car ride home, and this was the simplest option. We thought it would be faster than it was, so we could have gone somewhere better in the same amount of time."
UPDATE- Same great taste but awful portions. The order that you see here came to a sum of $70 and the forgot to include my mango lassi. Raised their prices and reduced their portions.
"Sad to leave this review, however have been giving the restaurant a number of visits with increasingly disappointing results. We also have left a few messages for Dario, who never calls 1. Today we ordered a vegetable fasilli and the chicken brick dish. Neither was very good. The pasta dish lacked flavor. There wasn't much in terms of vegetables. It was so disappointing I thought of taking a picture but it really was such a boring dish. White beans would give this some flavor and more protein. We've suggested they look at adding some beans to their vegan vegetarian dishes but have been met with radio silence 2 The chicken brick dish was not very good. Three people tried it and all were very disappointed. I'll try to add a picture of it. Very little of it was eaten. 3. The bread is an Average plus We used to go here years ago and it was pretty good. I Food today was from the Santa Barbara location on Victoria Street. We've also had disappointing meals At their montecito location. We really wish they would spend a little bit more time on their items and their ingredients especially for the pricing. Especially given they do not have good vegan options and haven't bothered to get back to us, we think we are done trying. Ciao Ca Dario"
"The spring rolls were good, the pork baboons were good but that one piece of mini cucumber did not give the crunch factor. The pork chashu ramen was a lukewarm, tepid broth. I'm not sure what the red strands were in the broth but by golly they were bitter. I asked for spicy chili oil on the side....$1.50 extra...I didn't know I paid extra until I looked at the receipt! It's not the money but the principle"
Beer is great. Dining way below average. Bartender was indifferent and failed to tell us about the specials. We only heard about these when he described them to our neighbor at the bar. Will not return. There are other breweries with great beer and good food.
"Can't say I would recommend - not worth the prices. We spent $96 here for two people - that includes two meals and one appetizer, no drinks. For what we got, it was not worth it. The ambiance,service and food just didn't live up to the money that can be spent elsewhere. We both did get seafood, which contributes to the price , however my meal (Picante de Camarones) was mostly rice and beans. I just can't justify spending ~$30 on mostly rice and beans ( which were nothing too special). The sauces on our meals were pretty tasty, but mine was kind of bland. My dining partner enjoyed their meal, however they also agreed they would rather have spent ~$35 elsewhere. We ordered the tamale as an appetizer and it was $13 for a single tamale- also just okay. There was only one waitress so wait times were a little long. The ambiance does not nearly make up for the prices either. Kind of tacky interior & music seemed like it was playing from someone's personal playlist. Overall, I would not recommend coming here, as you will spend a lot of money for not a lot of value."
"The proces were decent for how much food they gave. I ordered mapo tofu, and it just wasn't that. It was a brown sauce that was sweet - no spice at all and no option of tofu and ground pork. It was edible, but not what I wanted. They offer brown rice without upcharge which was nice. $8.45 for decent amount of general tso chicken, pork fried rice, and egg roll for dinner. Quick delivery. Just not the best I've had plus, they just don't make mapo."
We used to love going and ordering steak sandwiches and a basket of fries. Now the portions are much smaller and not worth the trip. Used to order a basket of fries and would split. Now comes on a tiny plate and are told that was only size. When one of our friends ordered a sandwich and his came with fries...larger portion than when ordering JUST fries. My friends that were loyal patrons (when they fly in from LA a bunch of us would meet here) have noticed the same thing. We won't be going back...unless things go back to normal.
Order was placed at 3:06P via mobile suppose to be ready at 3:12P didn't get served until 3:25P after I arrived at 3:10P waited and watched 6 people get served in front of me!!!! Called after I left talk to manger he apologized and let me know they were short staff.
"Less than stellar experience, service was good everything else no. Ordered farmers platter out of ribs, back up prime rib out of that as well. Opted for fried chicken specified thighs, got three pieces of 95% breading with dried out white meat sent this back next three were just as bad (18.99 to boot!). Won't be returning any time soon. Really missed the mark."
"The drinks were good. Bartender did his thing. Our waiter was personable and fun. But the food was lacking taste and heat. How do french fries come to the table lukewarm. My table mate said her chicken was overcooked, zapped too long in the microwave probably. My falafel was a crunchy dust ball. It was topped with what looked like ketchup. But the green salad it was on was fresh, it didn't have sauce but I guess the ketchup was the sauce. There was a side salad ordered by another table mate that was fresh. So they got the salad part right but they clearly need work in other areas."
"First time at JD. Ordered take out: Kung pao chicken, shrimp Lomein, firecracker chicken, fried dumplings & eggrolls. Nothing was particularly great or good. Not sure we would order again, as everything was a bit dry & over cooked. On a positive note, they are punctual. We showed up 15 minutes early, as from past experiences with take out orders, the food is usually ready before we arrive & we were trying to avoid picking up cold food. The girl that works there made it clear that she did not appreciate us arriving early... she told us very curtly, as she handed us our order 15 minutes later, we should call next time if we want to pick up early. Very odd way to interact with a customer, since we never made a fuss upon arrival and told them we were happy to wait, cuz we knew we were 15 minutes early."
"When did pizza become such a rip-off? For $30 I expected more than a long rectangle of chewy bread, a scant suggestion of sauce less toppings in the center, and a box with the precious Vetri name (even though he no longer owns it). The shape is for sure a clever way to increase the cheaper crust to pricier topping ratio. Really, people, buy a pizza stone and see how easy, cheap & fast it is to make excellent pizza yourself at home. You'll start calling these center city joints a rip-off too."
Gave them our number. Didn't receive text. We had only ordered fries and drinks. So after 20 minutes went up to ask. Then got cold fries and Luke warm sodas.
"If you've been to the location in St. Pete ... keep going there; no need to try this one. Thank me later. -Bruschetta - Half soggy, half hard, bread didn't seem fresh. -Gnocchi - Better at the St. Pete location, and had quite a spice/kick to it here. *Chicken Piccata - They don't serve it at the Tampa location. *Lobster Mac - They don't serve it. May be seasonal. *Fries - Those were good. -Bread - I feel like St. Pete serves bread prior to meal. The Tampa location did not. -Blackberry Ginger Smash - It was good."
Didn't care for it. Cute concept & love the name but the chicken was overly seasoned. The fries were basic as well.
"Chicago prices for sub par food. They start you out with some stale bread. In group of 6, Ordered 4 lackluster starters. Dry cardboard like truffle French fries, calamari that was basically just fried batter, escargot swimming in a butter bath. The pork belly that was just OK. But the waiter sure went on about how fantastic and perfect everything on the menu was. When the mains came, I found the sides to be unapealimy angus mid rare filet mignon over cooked but did have nice flavor. I should have sent it back but I was in a large party and at that point and was ready to move on with the evening."
Very generic Tex-mex with very pungent garlic. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the alcohol is pretty cheap.
I've come here every year for my birthday for the past 9 years. I was disappointed this year. Bring back the freshly baked bread. Pretzel bread does not taste well with oil and Parmesan cheese.
"I haven't eaten my food yet so I am extra bitter and maybe rambling on. I ordered chicken flautas -- noting that I wanted EXTRA guacamole. Order arrives and obviously no extra guacamole. Ugh. Sometimes folks forget. Times is hard. I forget. So I called. They proceed to tell me that the flautas don't come with guacamole. That is why they charged me for it. That I am wrong. That it isn't on the menu. Ahhhhhh. Also missing is the shredded lettuce but I don't need that. Also also didn't get the correct salsa I asked for. But none of that matters to me. Just my guacamole. Give me my guacamole, you liars."
"It's hard to find really tasty Chinese food. Combination fried rice, egg drop soup and low mein had zero flavor. I am giving 2 stars for the sesame chicken and chicken curry had a little more taste. The staff was super friendly but food lack spice and flavor."
"I've come here at least 3 times now and have always had great service and decent food. However, I came here with my friend last night and they forgot to put whiskey in her whiskey sour, my food came out 20 minutes later than my friend so they had to reheat her dish while she waited for my food to come out, and we had to flag down other employees to tend to us as our waiter did not. The trout I ordered was also over salted. The espresso martini was pretty good though. For the price and expectation of this place I expect nothing less than a stellar experience; especially service-wise. Disappointed to say the least."
"Disappointing...... We were excited to get a reservation on New Years Eve....even though they said sold out.....LOTS of empty tables..... 8pm......already out of their $5 Sourdough bread....so we order the flat bread....which was only a few slices....and drenched in oil....not good.... We ordered the oysters as an appetizer....the were the size of my thumb nail....and very fishy. You hate to complain, and ruin the mood on New Years Eve.....but we left very disappointed....."
"Let me start off with the positive open late with a limited menu. Great friendly staff location has a good beer selection. The pizza appears to be good.. then I try it .. unfortunately the flavor from piece to piece varies drastically. The first piece was hard and burned on the bottom with almost no flavor with heavy sauce at the crust, not across the whole pie. Then the second piece was better more balanced and not burned. Late night downtown Indy choices are limited. Maybe your luck would be better maybe I just got a bad pie. Hmmmmm maybe next time it will be better."
We came here a couple of weeks back on a Saturday night. Rushed our dinner to get there before the 8pm closing time. At 7:45pm they were waving us off like flies saying too late the store had closed. So rude! It's Saturday night and we wanted an after dinner sweet. Will not be back. Crazy they shut so early anyway.
I am sorry to share a poor review about this business but we have choices to make when we get something to eat at a restaurant. Not sure if new owners need to step up the quality but the pizza was poor at best! I hope this restaurant will improve because of it's location is convenient. Give it a try. Beware!
"This buffet isn't anything special. The food was subpar but the server was nice and attentive. We were surprised at the lack of offerings; pretty standard Chinese fare. For comparison, we ate at another Chinese buffet in Nampa where they have a huge spread. We found the desserts sorely lacking so we stuck with the soft serve ice cream machine. Their fruit offerings are pretty good. The chow mein was bland and the egg rolls were greasy. Lack of beef dishes as well. We were extremely surprised when we walked in that the prices were not advertised. We did our homework before we chose the restaurant and saw that on their website a weekday lunch is listed at $9.75. As soon as the server brought us or drinks she also left the check. To our dismay we were being charged $13.25 each which is the dinner price. We called the server over and asked her about the price and she said because it's a holiday. We didn't go on Thanksgiving or Easter; we went on MLK day. Totally ridiculous and price gouging! We are definitely one and done with this place!"
"Outrageous wait times even when there are many open tables and servers. We waited in line for 30 minutes just to be told it'll be an additional 30 minutes when there was 4 servers. The same thing happened to our party on a previous day when we tried to eat here, but then we were told it would be an additional hour on top of what we had already spent in line. Just go somewhere else to eat, you'll be back in the same amount of time."
The food is a no for me. Flavorless. Only up side about this place is they're open late on a weeknight and if you're starved you can get some bland food.
"Service was good, but food was not! I rarely write reviews, but had to share. My favorite salad is the Chicken quesadilla explosion salad. So, I know how it should look when it comes out. However, it was not recognizable and I told the server that's not what I ordered. She assured me it was, but it had very little lettuce, which was not fresh and it was already drenched with salad dressing. It was covered with sliced chicken, tons of overcooked tortilla strips and worst of all the cheese quesadilla triangles looked like they were left out overnight and place on the plate. I told the server my issues and she apologized, but I don't feel comfortable returning to this location."
"I expected more during our first experience at Carlucci's for dinner. Service was sub par and the indoor space is a little outdated however, comfortable. Food and drinks were OK but nothing to remember because it seemed overpriced."
"The Campbell location is an excellent, well-managed cafe with exceptional food and staff. We tried the Broadway location today. The food was mediocre in comparison and the service...what service? There are better places. Go to the Campbell location or try Bisquits a few doors down. Much better elsewhere."
"I had high hopes and ordered the Pho, but what a disappointment. It was luke warm and was basically water and noodles. I took it back and asked them for flavor and they said they forgot the broth flavoring. The staff added the broth and I added hoisin and sriracha, yet it was still terrible. A friend ordered another item and it was subpar too. Lastly, for a name like Lil Dumplings you would expect more options with dumplings. They only had three choices , but out of two."
Do you like a salty Pizza? Took out two large plains...Don't know at what part of the process some genius decided to make the finished product overly salty.... but that what it is. Did they get the wrong high schooler preparing the sauce this time... I can only guess... result for my family.. high sodium pizza. imo.. not safe for older folks..
It used to be good before the plannedemic 2020. Food is extra greasy now. Meat doesn't taste fresh like it used to be. Rice even tastes fake.
"The poor girl behind the counter has been slaving over online orders and walk-in orders for 20 minutes now. There's 4 of us in line, it shouldn't take this long. There shouldn't be just one employee handling all of this. Hire more employees and stop running out of fish (at a poke place) before 7pm. Step it up."
"I honestly cannot give Great Basin Brewing a good review. I wanted to like it since new ownership took over however my fish & chips & fries all were served cold, my husbands burger served cold. I informed the waitress and she microwaved my fish; It just made it soggy. The manager was kind enough to take it off my bill. I was so craving tasteful fish & chips this was definitely not the place for that. This is no Liberty on Sierra Street."
"It doesn't look like much when you walk by it, but when you get your food... you're right. It's nothing spectacular and they were out of a lot of things, like hash browns, spinach, and a few others. The coffee was pretty bad, but the music was the only thing that kept me from leaving. The pancakes were alright, but again, nothing special. The service was pretty slow, and usually the food makes up for it, but not in this case. The only thing that was special about this place was their band, but you can listen to them without eating there. If you do go here, if they are playing, tip the band. They deserve it!"
"They aren't getting things right the last few times we've been there. They keep forgetting things in the bag. Another example just recently ordered egg and cheese biscuit, spicy chicken biscuit, 3 hashbrowns. Got home only got two sandwiches had to run back up to get the hashbrowns got back home and wish would have opened up sandwiches cause got two reg chicken biscuits. The order on the bag had two stickers with exactly the order but none of the right food. Happening a lot there lately and super frustrating! Hashbrowns soggy and cold and one was barely filled...geesh"
"It's a pretty location, seems inviting until you get asked by the host to be sat at the bar, there's no one in the restaurant, we sit for 10 minutes at our table and have multiple people including the bartender walk by and glance our way. Instead of asking to be sat somewhere else I see 4 servers and the host just chilling at the host stand doing nothing so we left. Food smelled great and I'm sure the drinks were good but I'd pass this location by."
"I do not know how this place got such. High Yelp review. The restaurant itself is super tiny and cold. It was probably warmer outside. Eating our food wasn't enjoyable just because of how cold it was. I got the brown sugar boba. I don't know if it tasted like Soap or what. It wasn't good. Definitely wasn't sweet. If you want some good brown sugar boba, go to Whale Tea. Also, the boba itself wasn't even that good. They just had it in a container. I got the garlic chicken ramen. Absolutely so flavor. The chicken pieces had no flavor. Once I added Sriracha to it, it tasted way better, but I shouldn't have to add that for it to taste good. This place looks like it should be in the food court in the mall. We know the quality there."
"The pasta here is just aggressively mediocre. We were really excited because of how great the pictures were, but it genuinely was just ""ok"". Paying $18 for mediocre pasta is a huge letdown. I got the penne a la vodka, and it lacked any flavor at all. Watered down, salt less, I had to bury the dish in pepper and red pepper to taste anything at all. We also got a spaghetti, and the noodles were over cooked and the sauce tasted very odd, almost earthy? Overall, I'm really disappointed with the food. Our waitress was very kind though!"
I phoned the order in and was told food would be ready in 16 mins. We arrived about 20 mins later and the pizza was not even in the oven. Had to wait about another 25 mins. The wings were very good but the sauce on the pizza is a sweeter taste than we were used to but also had a spicy bite. I would not recommend this restaurant.
"So sad. I grew up in south STL and the Imo's out there and back then was the place to go. The pizzas, the meatball sandwich and hot roast beef..all fire. This location and overall the brand of Imo's has deteriorated so much over the years. I hate to say this, but STL Pizza and Wings is so much better and way more reasonable on price. Sorry Imo's. You're nit the same anymore."
"I just stopped in to Homage for a chai latte. I haven't been there in years, but I like supporting local, and I was in the neighborhood. Sadly, it was one of the weakest chai teas I've ever had. Little flavor, no spice added, and not as hot as I would like on this chilly morning. Their pastries looked amazing, there were quite a few people seated inside, and the staff was pleasant. Disappointed with my ""spiced"" chai tea."
"We went to Nunzio's for a date night, but unfortunately we had to wait over an hour for our food when there were many tables still open. The food is great, but the lack of awareness from our server and the wait time for the food was not worth it."
"I wanted this to be a place for me to frequent like Floras down the street. Nope. It's expensive. Don't get me wrong, I will PAY for a good dinner, but I went in to get dinner and I paid $18 for a salad. It was dinner. It was $18. I expected a dinner-salad. What I got was a pre-entre salad that did not stand up to the $18 price tag. A similar salad found at Wildflower for instance is $10. And that salad, I went wow, this is good! Tucson is a City of gastronomy--https://tucson.cityofgastronomy.org/about-- so there are a lot of quality dining options out there. I don't think this place will fare well with the $$$ price tag and the lack of quantity and quality of their food. If your staying at the Doubletree, venture out, Tucson has WAY more better options. Also, had our waitress not treated us like I was bothering her during our interactions, I would have been happy to tell her my thoughts in person instead of here..."
We arrived before 6 on a Thursday evening and were quickly seated inside. Our meals were okay; nothing to highly recommend but big portions. However it was SO crowded and SO loud that we couldn't wait to get out of there! Not recommended
Oh boy. So I paid $40 for 2 burgers an order of fries. The burgers were not special. I think I let a little tear go when I signed the check.
"Had high hopes, but very overpriced ramen for the quality and quantity. If I'm going to pay nearly $20 for a bowl I expect it to be top of the line and this place has dissapointed me every time :("
"Overall, we weren't impressed whatsoever. We placed our order online and we're hopeful for large portions given our extremely high ticket price. We got a few choices of meats and 5 different sides. The meat...pulled pork was incredibly dry. Like was this left over from the weekend? The beef brisket... it came in a round container which concerned me..when I opened it, imagine pulled pot roast. Zero smoke flavor and dry beyond our preference. My wife was looking forward to good brisket only to be very disappointed. The smoked sausage, best thing we tried but small portioned for what we were charged. The sides...oh the sides. Why is everyone afraid of seasoning? Literally where is the salt and pepper at least? Mac and cheese, boxed flavor. Green beans, bland. Slaw, blah. Baked beans, tasted like beans with a bottle of bbq sauce squeezed into them. Brunswick stew was like eating leftover stew that someone tried to spice up with more bbq sauce. Will we be back? Maybe. Recommend to friends, no. Worth the price you pay, absolutely not."
"Confusing menu, food isn't much to write home about. I've had a lot of sushi but would rate this sushi as disappointing. It's not bad by any means, just not worth your time when there are better options nearby. The portions were generous, however."
"Three years after my earlier review, and nothing seems to have improved. This time I skipped the ""meat and three"", and decided to see how they would do with that ""All-American"" favorite, the cheeseburger and fries. First, the good part. The french fries, even though they were obviously previously frozen, were excellent. They were served hot, slightly crisp on the outside, perfectly done on the inside. But the sad part was that the burger wasn't as good as any you could get at the fast food joints just off the Interstate. Disecting it, patty looked fresh, but was completely devoid of flavor. Apparently they didn't even have salt or pepper. One last comment: the coffee was just dreadful. It tasted like they used whatever they could get at the lowest possible price. C'mon folks. At least try to get the coffee right."
"I understand making mistakes with a sandwich but I would bet money that both employees were high as a kite when my daughter and I came in today. Ingredients were added to a sandwich that were never mentioned, others that were requested were left off completely, and I've never seen someone make a sandwich so slowly. Don't go to work high, kids. Customers can definitely tell even if you think they can't."
"Did the ""when in Philly, get a Philly cheesesteak"" thing. Hate to say it, don't love Genos. First time I had a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead of shredded. Also the last time I will have a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead to shredded. What an odd concept. I will say the employees were kind and extremely fast at getting the food out so kudos to them. The cheesesteak was so basic. Just a slice of cheese, thick slices of tomatoes, a ton of onions, and let's hear it, sliced meat. Wish it was more cut up and mixed around and blended together but I suppose when you are Genos, quantity is more important than quality."
"Cute atmosphere, food is not very good. Idk why this place has so many stars. Salad was SO over dressed I couldn't even eat any of it. Chicken is that disgusting chewy chicken you dread getting served. Skip"
I want to like this place... But the service and staff just kind of suck... Honestly they could seem to care less on the product they put out... I don't think I've had a hot taco yet... Which is sad because I think of many of them could be better if they were served fresher and with a little care... honestly Del taco and Taco Bell serve warmer fresher and better put together tacos and we've all seen what they look like...The beans with the green stuff in them I don't know what that is but it's not Mexican food... Not even edible to me Imho
Came early on New Years Eve. Waitress was fantastic. Food was pretty subpar. For some reason the hostess felt the need to correct my husband of 36 years on who should go first. Crazy
"Live music was great. That's all I can say because I sat here for an hour without being helped. Finally caved and got a drink from the bar. Came for the ""free sunset shooter"" that never happened."
"Usually always happy with the seafood trio. This time not so much. Very skimpy on the seafood, barely a octopus leg if reconstructed. A few shrimps and a few scallops. Very sad. They piled in the sides to fill the plate. I understand prices have gone up but this was very disappointing."
"I'm really disappointed in Shokku Ramen. When a ramen place opened up so near my home AND they promised to have Miracle Noodles on the menu (I would have been fine with any gluten-free noodle but I was especially excited to try those), I was so thrilled. I went one time early last summer (before I became more seriously gluten free out of medical necessity) and was told after an incredibly long wait that they were ""working on their staffing issues"" and that they would have the noodles ""soon."" It's been over six months, yet the company is still saying the same thing about staff and the noodles have been taken off the menu altogether for a few months now. Thoroughly annoyed with their lack of inclination to make actual changes... especially in a neighborhood like Hillsboro Village. What a letdown."
"Let me start by saying Central Taco & Tequila is a nice, stylish, well lit and clean restaurant with a very nice staff. If you're looking for Mexican-ish or Mexican-style food then you will LOVE this establishment. However, my girlfriend and I were under the impression that we would be eating actual Mexican food and that was were things fell apart. Putting beans, rice and meat in a tortilla may add up to ""Mexican food"" on paper, but I can say with absolute certainty that there is not one Mexican chef, owner or other employee that is involved with making this food. Eating here is like doing Taco Tuesday over your white best friends parents house in middle school. I'm quite confident our burritos were from an El Paso kit found in the ""ethnic aisle"" at Shop Rite. The guacamole tasted like it was squeezed from a plastic package. If it were made on the premises I'm not sure if that would be better or worse. It just had no flavor and no soul. If you're dropping in for a drink on happy hour, they have some nice beers and tequila flights, but if you want Mexican food, an assembly line Chipotle burrito feels infinitely more autenticó. If for strange reason the Cartel came to Haddon Township and had to eat this food, they would almost certainly dismember anyone involved with making it. Two stars."
"We were not pleased at all. The biscuits were small and hard. The glaze was ok, but where was the cinnamon? I especially wanted to try them because I heard good things. When my hubby walked in to pick up our order, ( I had called ahead!) they weren't ready and the young man just grabbed them, poured the glaze over them and that was that! It was 90 min before closing time, but they were in a rush to close! Not sure if we'll try them again!"
We have been to Sunset Sushi on numerous occasions. Normally the food and service is good. The past two occasions were terrible. Tonight we arrived at 5:15 and were the first people seated. We promptly ordered. It took over a hour to get our food. We saw other people get up and leave. At a minimum the management should have taken something off the bill. Will not be back.
"Interestingly we've been here a few times, normally one of our stops for dinner while in town, however, this time was absolutely not great. Bland over cooked food, poor service, and sub par in general, not a good look for the most expensive steak house open with expectations of such. When the waiter clears you plate still full of food and fails to even ask if everything was ok, tells me they don't care. This will more than likely be my last visit to Luckys, there are just too many restaurants that are doing good things to pay supremely overpriced fares for lackluster food"
"I was so excited to try this place in Reading Terminal as I had heard rave reviews and saw the line wrapping around the shop. Sadly the food did not live up to the hype. I got the classic roast pork sandwich they are known for. The pork itself was dry and not juicy enough, The broccoli rabe added a slight mustardy taste that did not complement the rest of the sandwich. Overall, it was just an okay sandwich. I found it quite bland and it definitely could've used more sauce or something to add flavor."
I won't name the server by name but he needs more training! He was nice but NEEDS more training! Place wasn't even half full. 8pm. He had 2 tables. 3 total people to help. I asked for water 3x. Asked for green tea. Never got it. Never got water either. Got the water from someone else. 20 mins later he asks if he can get me anything else. I say some water please! Told him he forgot the tea. He was nice about it but left it on the bill. He took it off. Left me with no pen for 10 more mins. Ugh!!! Train him! You pay for the food AND the experience. Make it better. --Sushi was good. Calamari was way different than in the menu. (See photos)
Food is ok but has no spice or real flavor. It is obviously catering to a specific type of white person that lives in this area. Bland flavorless food with mediocre service. Depending on the day you will find the staff less than friendly. We all have bad days but it seems they're just bitchy a lot. Definitely don't consider this Mexican food but more of a white man's TexMex.
The location is great. The build is new and nice. The signage is eye catching and bring people in. The decor is typical. The photos of the family traveling is a neat idea. The menu has a good variety. Food is definitely Americanized. The food is just average. The chips and salsa are extra and the guacamole seemed a little over priced but I'm not sure how much avocados cost in Idaho. The actual meals were just okay. I have eaten here twice now and not impressed. The kitchen sink burrito was not good. Unfortunately it tasted just like it's name. Sounds mean but my 13 year old cooks better than that. It was busy on the inside and was difficult to find a table. There was a super large group that had no common courtesy and acted like they were the only people in the world. They had already finished and were just hanging out and talking. They had no responsibility for their kids and they were running around inside like it was a playground. This part was not really in control of the business but they could have maybe mentioned for them to leave when completing their meal so others who had ordered could sit down and enjoy their meal. And to not let their kids run around bothering others. I have a family four kids but would never let them be disrespectful to others and behave in such a manner.
The place went completely downhill after Covid. The ingredients are not the same. They no longer have the Red Fish. The menu doesn't have much on it as they use to. I won't be going here anymore
"Visiting from out of the area. Soup du jour was cauliflower scallop. Delicious! Except there was no detectable cauliflower. Tasted like cream of mushroom with some scallops thrown in. Entree was medallions of veal with potatoes Anna. Veg was a mixture of tomatoes, mushrooms & kale. Veal was poorly trimmed...raggedy hunk hanging off one, fat blob on another. And, sadly, overcooked and a bit tough. The potatoes & veg were poorly seasoned. No detectable salt in one bite, overwhelming amounts in the next. The potatoes were dry as a bone. Dessert was the Grand Mariner soufflé. Beautifully baked and looked wonderful. Horribly sweet and a total miss. Wouldn't recommend and would never go back. Service wasn't great either. Very long waits, no offer of coffee or a second glass of wine and we had to push our dishes across the table to hint they they needed picking up."
I wanted to like this place. I was following them for a long time on instagram and finally had time to go in. I thought the ambiance was alright. Very tight space and does need a deep clean. The food was very mid. Too much frozen stuff for me.
We ordered food for delivery. It took 2-1/2 hours to get delivered. I've ordered from here for the past 6 years. Not even a phone to let me know what's going on. I even called and she said they were backed up. I asked if my order had even been out for delivery yet. This 1-1/2 after my order. She said she didn't know.
ordered pick up with door dash my gravy was liquid not thick at all. The rest of the food does look good though.
You guys got rid of a lot of great things on the menu. I was very disappointed when I could not order the beef stroganoff or even pizza. Only ordered drinks and then left. This used to be a go to place but not anymore.
"Service was great, but the food was meh. I ordered the Western omelette and the onion and peppers were kind of raw. The pancakes my partner ordered upset both of our stomachs (either that or it was the water). Utensils were also a little dirty. Standard diner with room for improvement. The server was wearing a face mask the entire time, and the booths are distanced/separated, which we appreciated"
"We select Pearl based on a local. Allowing for slower service, most restaurants are short staffed, we still found service lacking. Apps came with no one to check on us, and we ordered salads with dressing on the side, not an unreasonable request for an upscale restaurant.- Salad came drenched in dressing and two upcharge Caesar's came with tired brown lettuce (sent back). The fish special was OK, but a very small portion and at $52.00 disappointing. My daughter ordered seafood pasta which had a decidedly strong unpleasant aroma, not sure if was the spice or fish. Overall dinner for four with 2 glasses of wine was about $300.... we are not going back."
"Placed our order through Grubhub at 6 pm on a Friday for 1 pasta dish and 1 pizza. Estimated 45-50 min wait time. After 45 mins, got a notice that they accidentally gave our order to someone else. Mistakes happen. But it took another 50 minutes for them to remake and deliver our order. Disappointing that we didn't get our order prioritized (shouldn't take 50 mins to make 1 pizza and 1 pasta dish and deliver it 7 minutes away). When I called to ask about the long wait and check on my order (1.5 hours after I placed my order), I was told they only had 2 hostesses instead of 3 working that night. While it did sound busy in the restaurant, it shouldn't take 3 hostesses to ensure the right orders are picked up, nor do hostesses make the actual food or prioritize the orders. When then food did arrive, the pizza was cold and lacking in flavor. The pasta was warm but also lacking in overall flavor. Order local (Bar Sera, Bar Luca, Pepperoncini's in Conshy or Pietro's in Radnor) for better service and quality. Management needs to step up the game if they want their chain to compete with other options in the area with food that is as good or better and with better service. This could be the outlier but we won't be ordering again."
"Ok, so I only way the ravioli sometimes I get some fries Now there's this new thing you can only order online , here's the thing ONLINE YOU MUST SIGN INTO TO SOME ACCOUNTS, and everything you want is NOT even there to order .. for example (plain fries/ small salad/house salad).. it's realllll hard to give my money to them at this point .. and you can just give up trying to get someone on the phone because that's not going to happen .. whoever's idea this only online thingy was must not have been thinking AT ALL that day .."
"I don't hate it here, but I definitely don't love it. Came in on a Friday lunch and the place was dead. Took about 20 minutes just to get some rum drink with an extra ""floater"" that tasted like straight cranberry juice and sugar. Opted to get a beer flight after 2 sips of my drink. Beer flight was good, okay selection of beers. We ordered a crab rangoon dip as an appetizer and felt like we were just eating warmed cream cheese - NOTHING close to those delicious pockets of crabby goodness you'd normally get! The 2 things this place has going for it are the open air concept on both floors and their lobster roll. Lobster was fresh and plentiful on the roll. Good taste and perfect size!"
"When you order pad Thai, you might expect a peanut sauce and that traditional dish you get from a Thai restaurant, but that's not what Thai Kitchen will serve you. It's a bit more of a sweet teriyaki thing. Pretty over seasoned so by the time you get to the bottom, it's a little much. Kind of gut bomb-y. Can't say I'd go back, but I think the college crowd loves it."
"Currently sitting in the drive thru...24 minutes the longest wait ever! The van in front of us took up 15 minutes ordering, meanwhile in the right lane 4 cars already went thru. The difference between this visit and others, there is no one out there taking orders. Never again."
"Located at the end of B Terminal, social distancing seems to be a thing of the past, all customers shoved on one side of the restaurant. Only breakfast at 10:30a. Bland shrimp and grits. Wait staff seems bored and unfamiliar with ""If you can lean, you can clean"". But you are trapped. Metaphorically."
"I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the chain. There's better local options here in Nashville. I haven't been to a PF Chang's in easily a decade but we met another couple here at their request to have dinner. The Mu Shoo Chicken is no longer in the menu which is what I ordered so I opted for the pad Thai chicken and was left disappointed as there was zero flavor to it. Go to Deg Thai or Smiling Elephant or Soy Bistro if you want actually great food cooked well with flavor and seasoned. The wait was long even with a reservation, as we got seated a half hour after our call ahead time and the service was okay at best. Next time we'll recommend going to our local faves when meeting these friends rather than waste our time and money with lackluster food."
"On my quest to find a good liver dish with nice wine in Philly, I ventured to Jake's. Upon entering, I was calmed by the dim(ish) lights, warm colored walls, and low music. A relaxed but semi-fancy atmosphere, depending on where you'd sit. The Boudreaux wine we ordered was quite delectable- dry, not too sweet, and a woodsy aftertaste- however, that was the end of my meal's delight. The ""calve"" (it's calf!) liver I ordered medium was well-done with no pink, and was served atop an apple potato salad you would get made by your aunt that can't cook at a family picnic. I get they were trying to be clever - liver and ""caramelized"" onions (which had 0 flavor, barely cooked, and caramelized onions are usually my favorite salty topping to ANY savory dish) with apple - but the flavors mixed together sabotaged each other. On their own, each was not too shabby. Additionally, the portobello mushroom soup was nothing to call home about - it reminded me of the Campell's can of cream of mushroom soup your parents would force you to eat as a kid. My boyfriend's slow-cooked pork was the best (and only) amazing item I tried that night- for the prices (30$ for a sub-par liver and the equivalent of one small white potato) I think this place is overrated, and would call this diner quality food (no offense to diners) at a romantic atmosphere restaurant."
It was okay. We made a reservation for a Monday which was totally unnecessary but it is what it is. The menu online did not reflect the menu in the restaurant but we were fine with that. We decided to get fried alligator as an app (free with a Yelp check-in!) and it was super chewy with too much breading. For my entree I had the crawfish pasta. The entree was very good but could have used more crawfish. Our drinks were very weak. Our waiter was disengaged. The manager who helped with the free app was nice. The hostess wanted to be anywhere but there. Still giving three stars because it's still a pandemic yada yada.
"After visiting a handful of times over the past year or so I would put edison at 3.5 stars (rounding down to 3 due to the pricing). The service is consistently very good and the creativity is commendable but something about the food always leaves me wanting. I read the menu and am always intrigued and excited by the combinations but then the food comes and it feels like something is missing. After the 20+ dishes I have tried I can say that nothing has ever been ""bad"" (no small feat given some of the combinations they pull off), but also nothing has ever been DELICIOUS. At the end of the day the day the dishes are more memorable on the page than on the palate. Will be interesting to see what Michelin makes of edison later this year. Lastly, I'll say that the price increases are obscene. Some dishes have nearly doubled in price since our first visit. The food is simply not good enough, nor generous enough to justify the current price. After our most recent visit, our group went for burgers given we were still hungry and not willing to spend $100 per person at dinner. I'm sympathetic to food costs, supply chain, labor costs etc. however we regularly eat out at other leading restaurants in the area and have not had this experience anywhere else. I hope they can figure out their sourcing."
"I always enjoy the food, but every time I go to get food the guy behind the counter never responds or communicates and just walks away. You don't see him again until he brings you your food. Even when ordering to go, it'd be nice to know if it's going to be a few more minutes before it's ready, rather than retreating to the kitchen without any info. It's a small thing that makes a BIG difference."
The salads are excellent crisp and large. The pizza however is always undercooked and soggy at the center. The toppings are incredibly abundant a result of too much sauce and if ordering anything with vegetable topping the same issue is even worse. Be prepared to pop the pizza on to your own preheated oven pizza stone and bake a bit more which helps. Or perhaps recook each slice in a non stick pan. Regrettably this is the problem which is a shame. Never ordered anything else beyond salad and pizza. In person service is hyper to order and takes a normal time to bring out. The and the staff are loud and live in their own world with annoying music and shenanigans. They are oblivious to how weird they come across.
"Run of the mill diner. Nice place to stop by for a late-night dinner as it is open 24 hours. The food is just okay, but that is to be expected. Our waitress was nice."
DELICIOUS FOOD!!! It's a Tucson Gem. Truly one of the last few great spots to get authentic food. I like the sushi however I sat at the bar once (I've been going here for years) and I really lost my appetite after seeing the way the sushi chefs were not sanitary at all. I also noticed one of the sushi chefs go to the bathroom with his gloves on and walked out with them on and still went straight back to work. I was in shock and ended up ordering Ramen instead. The SERVICE though is truly wonderful. The ladies who are waitresses are fantastic.
"From the music to the Aloha greetings when you walk in, they really attempt to give you a Hawaiian vibe in the restaurant and I'll give them credit for that. Unfortunately, the sushi isn't that great. I've lived in Hawaii so I know good fish and this just isn't it. I don't even think it's as good as some that I've had on the mainland. It's worth a try, but don't be surprised if you're disappointed."
"Let me start by saying that everyone from the hostess to the waiter were amazing, I just wish the food was as great as the staff. The Gumbo was lacking in substance and flavor. The jambalaya was could and the rice was over cooked and mushy. The Red Beans were Amazing! The cocktail was fun but weak."
"Very friendly service, but took quite a while for the food to come out. Food was ok (chile relleno). The ice tea was bad. The water used had a bad flavor and overpowered the tea. Small setting and the couple next to us didn't know a vocabulary beyond the f word. Not the restaurant's fault, but certainly interfered with our meal. Not sure I'll return."
"The food and service on New Year's Eve was excellent. That said, we paid much more than we expected to pay for dinner, partially because we didn't get a text telling us about the special menu and $124 per person for New Year's Eve because my husband's cell phone had been stolen. I did receive a reminder email from Yelp on 12/29 but it reinforced the $49 meal price. Since the price included wine pairings, it wasn't unreasonable. But my husband doesn't like wine so we probably would have cancelled had we known. While the problem with the text wasn't the restaurant's fault, I do have an issue with the 20 percent ($50) Fourking Fee we were charged on top of the 20 percent tip. There was no mention of this extra fee anywhere I can find in the text or on the website. All-in-all, two dinners with wine and a beer cost $379."
"Our food order was deserving of five stars. My husband ordered the Pad Thai (his favorite) and I had the chicken fried rice. Both were served piping hot and full of flavor. Our service though was INTENSE. Our waitress had zero patience as we placed our order, although we knew what we wanted to order she was walking away as we were still explaining the specifics of our order. She did this again when we had a request for condiments. She wouldn't slow down long enough to listen to us and by the time she returned with what we needed, we were finished eating and looking for our bill. This is truly one of our favorite places to eat, I just hope we never get this server again."
Drink selection here is probably a 4/5 but so/so quality bar food with an exceptionally long wait every time I'm here lately. The turnaround times for entrees is also insanely long and on more than one occasion I've had subpar attitudes from waiters here. The beer variety is their truly redeeming quality and they do a good job sourcing from local brewers!
The bar is Christmas themed. I got the Grinch shot and another drink in a Santa boot. Paid about 35-40 bucks for both and that's including the tip I added for the bartender. Both drinks were very sweet not enough to get you tipsy. If you're looking for a fun place to meet your friends to start the night Tinsel is it. The staff was friendly and the holiday chair was the perfect instagram photo spot. If you're worried about Covid no one wears masks inside. It's very crowded on the weekend and they do check to confirm everyone has been vaccinated. Better late than never but happy holidays.
"I heard about this historic place that you HAVE to eat at if you visit New Orleans, so we came. The atmosphere and nostalgia behind this place is what earned it the 3 stars. The food was nothing special or anything that made the hype worth it. It's your average southern food joint. I was prepared to have my eyes rolling in the back of head after the first bite, but that wasn't the case. By no means was it nasty, it just wasn't delicious. If you're going to visit, do so, but don't be expect to have your taste buds blown away."
"We came in for dinner during a snow storm and when we were there we saw a fun band play some bluegrass music and they were very good. The restaurant got very busy once the band started playing and the place is small so it was a bit loud. We ordered the sweet potato hush puppies, which were pretty good, and we had the half chicken and burger for dinner. The chicken was good but it came with croutons and cold tomatoes for the ""vegetable"" so we had to order another item due to the plate being quite small. The chicken was good but it was a little expensive for what we got."
"Started price gouging! I've been eating here for at least a decade. Prices have always been fair and Gyros are great. Inflation sucks and is a part of life in 2022...but Gyroshack got greedy. 36% increase. Sorry, you'll need to resolve your business model as I'm not paying $8 for a Gyro...no other fast food has gone up 36%, you're being greedy. Ironically as other reviews have mentioned, they don't even pay their employees enough ($7.50) to eat at their own restaurant! When you're driving slave labor and implementing massive price increases you know this establishment has jumped the shark. Interesting to hear they have fairly new ownership...go figure."
This was more like 2.5 stars but I rounded up for the fries. I saw this on Uber Eats and this is right around where we live so I thought I would give it a try. Ordered the Philly cheesesteak for my husband and I got the Dagwood. The wheat bread was over toasted and dried out. Meat was not a substantial enough amount. Condiments and toppings were actually good and fresh. The fact that they have fresh cut fries was nice because sometimes you just don't want chips. Probably wouldn't go back.
"First time and was excited to try THE CAFE DU MONDE beignets. However, when we arrived the line wrapped around. We had to wait 30+ minutes in the cold before we can place our order. Keep in mind that this location accepts cash only. The tables and chairs are not really cleaned throughout after people leave so beware. We order one order of the beignets which comes with 3 pieces. When we open the bag, the beignets looks disappointing and not the puffy cloud beignets it was supposed to be. It looks just like random blobs. However, it taste amazing! Please keep in mind that there are many locations of Cafe Du Monde in NOLA so I would recommend checking the other locations if you don't mind not going to the original location."
Went one night for a quick bite and drinks! Wings were amazing! Like really good. Also for a burger off HH menu. Was supposed to come with lettuce and tomato and had no tomato. Asked to be cooked medium and came out Med well to well done. All in all...go for the wings.
"Came on a weekday for lunch around 11:30AM, not too crowded, private parking lot in the back, has outdoor seating. Got the Tuck Special, didn't realize it didn't come with sides and is a sandwich. Flavor was quite delicious from the pimento cheese and sauce, but the brisket wasn't anything special. It was a bit hard and not flavorful at all, and I added a bunch of the BBQ sauce on the table to it. Mac and cheese was a bit sweet or something, somewhat odd. Really liked the grits though!"
"Kind of a major tourist trap here but you gotta have a cheesesteak when in Philly. Located near the Ben Franklin museum, this was very quick and easy after a long morning of museums. Lots of options on the cheese so take a step back and really take a look at the menu. Ordering felt a little rushed. We had the classic cheesesteak. Wished we mixed it up a little. The fries were fresh. If I could have just had a beer with it, it would have been perfect!"
"We sat outdoors, and I have to say, the setting is wonderful. Right in the middle of all the action, with the glorious St. Pete waterfront right across the way. Our server Chase was charming and attentive. The smoked salmon sandwich was out of this world. But the shrimp po'boy was such a disappointment. It's not a po'boy if it is not on a French roll, and this was on a ciabatta roll and a stale one at that. Inexcusable. We travel all over the country and it really is hard to find a great mid-priced restaurant. I had high hopes for this place but no, it fell short. We had to wait 20 or 30 min for a table and we saw several empty, unbussed tables. It was okay, we walked around the park in the sunshine and with every business short-handed these days I really can't hold that against them."
Ok disclaimer that this review may be unpopular but it is my opinion only. We were staying in the area and had heard about this bakery which was known for some great breakfast sandwich items so we stopped by. We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the crispy chicken sandwich. Breakfast sandwich: 3/5 Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more. Chicken sandwich: 4/5 After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side. I wish the bacon pieces were thinner and crispier.
"Love me some Oscar's. But, if you're going to offer breakfast burritos in the menu, maybe be open during breakfast hours?"
"The food and drinks here are solid, but the wait time for food was obscene. Our reservation was on a Friday night at 7:15pm. The appetizers and drinks came out reasonably quickly, but did not get our entrees until closer to 9:30pm, maybe an hour and a half after appetizers came."
"I'm torn on this place - we were really hoping for a great experience. Our waiter was wonderful. Very attentive and one of the only reasons we would give another try. Steak was very very underwhelming and not cooked to the right temperature. Fish dish was just meh. The bill was crazy expensive for such subpar food, but I just can't help thinking we should try just one more time. First experience definitely missed the mark on the food."
"The food was good and the service was adequate if not slow. The Prosecco, beet and citrus terrine, and crème brûlée was great and we should have stopped there. We spent more time waiting for food, to take orders, and the bill than we did eating and drinking. When a plate of food is served, the protein should face the diner so they don't have to use their napkin to turn around a screaming hot plate in order to eat their food. We ordered Prosecco and the menu (with wine list) was taken. We eventually asked another waiter for a wine list and apparently the fact it was on the table again wasn't hint enough. But then we never saw our waiter again before another server delivered the food. Apparently wine was not an option for us. Hint: we wanted wine. Did I not realize it's a self serve joint? We were seated immediately next to the entrance of the outdoor seating area (very nice), where apparently 3-4 servers decide to hang out while while waiting for something to do. While all seemed very nice, not exactly great ambiance compared to others who were seated further down, and frankly, seemed to get more attention. Three scallops, mashed potato's and asparagus for $45 seems a bit overpriced even in this area and at that service level is a really disappointing. We finally asked for the bill so we could get up and leave."
"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, nice & fancy set up. Parking is ok, the area gets crowded but if you're patient you'll get a parking space. Service was decent, despite us being place way back of the restaurant. Everyone but me enjoyed their food. I'm not sure I'll be back."
"Can be a little hit or miss, but you definitely need to eat in here rather than get takeout. The vibes are great and the beer selection is awesome"
Well gotta say this was my first trip in and I wasn't overly thrilled I ordered a large burrito the pork verde one while it was big and hot there wasn't much meat in it the flavor of the meat was also bland it was nearly all rice past that I'd give it maybe 4 out of 10. Service was quick though...
"Ate here about a week ago. Our server was great and very attentive. My hubby and I ordered the beef fajitas. I only got 3 small one inch pieces of lettuce and small amount of pico. The guac was fantastic as it has been in prior visits. The steak was cooked well, but over seasoned. Limited menu compared to the past and beer selections very limited."
"We happened upon Blanco Cocina + Cantina on December 30th 2021... and I'm so glad we did. We were in town to watch our Purdue Boilermakers take on the Tennessee Volunteers in the Music City Bowl. It was a beautiful day, and we needed to fuel-up before the big game. This attractive restaurant is right on Broadway. I would not call this an authentic Mexican restaurant; but rather an upscale, Americanized, Mexican restaurant. Our waiter was very nice, and hustled his butt off. He mentioned they are known for their Short Rib Machaca meat. I ordered The Tucson Chimichanga with ... (you guessed it) Short Rib Machaca. It had good flavor but the meat was a little too mushy. It came with rice and beans. I loved the rice! My wife had The Little Gem Caesar salad with steak. It was tasty. This is a solid restaurant. I'm not sure when I'll be in Nashville again, but I'll definitely keep this place in mind!"
"The food here is good, but the guy who is usually here running the register is not friendly and to be honest, it limits my ability to enjoy the food. Recently, for several months a friendly woman ran the register and my wife and I began to frequent this establishment more often. Today we discovered that the guy is back.... So likely we will decrease our visits again as a result. Maybe we will just do a drive by to see who is running the register. Maybe we will just go elsewhere."
"Food was good, but bar service/takeout process needs improvement. The kitchen was pounding orders out and I saw bags & boxes sitting without being delivered for take outs. The gentleman next to me goes 4 nights a week and wasn't even offered water while he sat at the bar waiting to be served; he left and I waited 45 min for my order which was cold by the time I got home. Was disappointing. In their defense, it was a wicked busy night, and, I only went once. There were a bunch of regulars which speaks loudly to their core customers devotion to restaurant."
"3.5/5 This was our first time ordering and unfortunately we weren't blown away like the other reviews said we would be. I got the besties 2: chicken and pork with Mac n cheese Hubs got the pulled pork sandwich with beans. We both agreed the best part of the meal was the bbq sauces! That bestie sauce I don't regret trying this while in town, but we preferred pappy's."
"Have been there before & really enjoyed it, but this time the sauce was tasty on the boil,but almost completely oil! Also there was a lot of in the shell crawdads. They only have a bite of meat in the tail. Not a very good value for the price. We ordered the Black Pearl. Also, even though we had 4 adults and a 2yo with an 11 yo, only the 4 adults ordered food and the kids ordered drinks, we were automatically billed an 18% tip so our bill came to approx. $228.00. An expensive lunch!"
I had the chicken fried steak special. The steak was over cooked and dry. The gravy was bland. The hash browns were old and not hot. All this for 15$. There are better breakfast spots.
"Great atmosphere and sat outside on deck. $16 for bread and salad and meal and dessert for that price on lunch menu. Scallops were wonderful. I would not recommend the meatloaf as it was ""mushy"". Overall great place and good service."
"Got a vanilla iced latte with oat milk, a chai tea late, and a caramel brûlée latte. They gave me an extremely small cup for the latte and it was still about $4. The cups were also sticky."
This used to be a pizza place I can count on for whenever I crave for pizza. Sadly this time my experience was subpar. Garlic bread was mostly bread with hints of garlic and the margarita pizza had a burnt base. Everything tasted average at best. Gonna have to hunt for a new place. :(
"Let's get right to the point: this place is an ugly twin of Panda Express; it's identical with pricing and food options, but the quality is slightly lower. I think Panda Express is God's gift to mankind, so I thought this place was average. However, I realize any normal person would have probably throw up, and so I am reluctant to give 3 stars, but it's because there can be only one greasy-unauthentic-Asian-running-to-the-bathroom establishment, and that's Panda Express."
Always good food but came in tonight with my family only to be told the dining room was closed. We ate in the car but a sign posted at the door would've been a good idea. Many customers were irritated.
"L O C A T I O N ! On recommendation from my daughter who had visited Clearwater Beach, and an old high school friend who lives nearby, we had lunch here. On vacation Minnesota, any seafood was appealing! Crab & Shrimp Chowder. 4 stars Grouper Cheeks. 4 stars Chicken Nachos. 3 stars The Grouper Cheeks were SO DELICIOUS, but I ate too many. Tummy ache, my bad. Chowder, very Floridian. Nachos, near impossible to get from plate to mouth. Our server was a pleasant gal, Julia, but the outstanding feature was the sea view. A little too chilly to have our lunch on the deck, but we were seated by the window. Mesmerizing! Add the guitars with the live music, and a memorable lunch was had. But then the bill arrived, I was astounded by how overpriced it was. Guess that's the amenities price, but all the other restaurants in the area are not that over priced. Just an FYI. O V E R P R I C E D BY A M I L E !"
"My pizza joint mission is on a roll, visiting places that serve slices and this was on my list. It was around two in the afternoon and it was time to get a couple slices. Counter service like all real pizza joints and I guess because of covid, there was no indoor seating nor outdoors, this was no concern to me. I ordered the two slice deal and sat in the shade by my car. I will say this, the crust was thin crispy and perfectly done. However, I will say this, they use a lower quality cheese and perhaps too much. Yea, I know, too much cheese? With too much low quality cheese I really couldn't get a take on the sauce. My recommendation to the owner would be get a better cheese, use less and it could be a four start pizza. Since this section of 4th Street don't have any other pizza by the slice, please stop in and let me know what you think."
Cool ambiance. Food was OK. I ordered the Sausage Risotto and my husband got the wagyu steak. He commented that he's had better steak for a lot less price. The Risotto was fine but I feel like there are probably better meals on the menu. I'd consider going back and trying something else. The service was kind of slow but it didnt bother me too much because it let me slow down and take in the night. But heed the warning if you have firm plans after dinner; give yourself more time. They have a piano man with table service on the piano. I'd love to do that sometime!
"My partner had the Parma Hash which he enjoyed very much. I had the Classic Eggs Benedict which was okay but not great. Was lukewarm, possibly because of the cold tomato that was part of the dish. Service was perfunctory."
"Only giving this place a 3 star rating because the manager made up for all the mistakes with mu hubby's meal by comping our whole meal! My husband ordered eggs benedict with the eggs poached hard ( he doesn't like runny yolk ) First order, the eggs were totally runny! Sent it back, the second time, they had very little sauce! So he asked just for some more sauce & they said no we'll have them make it again, took forever! He waited about 45 mins! I was done with mine by the time they got his right! Unacceptable! Will probably not be back! Too bad. We feel like ever since the pandemic, the customer service industry has just gone downhill! They don't care at all"
"So, went here for me and my boyfriends 1 year anniversary. The atmosphere was beautiful, very inviting. The salad bar was horrible. The food brought to you by waiters was good, the meat was great. But there were no sides....so it was a shitty salad bar with a lot of meat. It was $65 a plate, which honestly I'd rather go to a really fancy restaurant and get a MEAL..not some glorified BBQ. I would suggest replacing the literal potato salad and glazed peanut bar with vegetables, noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, stews. Went for the gimic, won't go back for the food."
The frybread was good but it didn't have any sauce or toppings other than lettuce and cheese which made it rather dry and chewy.
"We came here on NYE. Our service was great the waitress was a doll and I had no issues with that. The food is underwhelming and I think over priced. My tenderloin was small and lacked flavor: the pasta course was slimy and the broth was too strong. Salad was good. The crème brûlée which I would've loved to order was ruined by adding ginger. I got blackberry sorbet. Meh. For the cost of the food I would think they could update the interior, it is dated with diff light fixtures and no consistent design or ambience. Same as it was 15 years ago. The other restaurant they own is Acero and that is one of my favorite places. They are very nice here but I'm not rushing back."
"We tried this Diner today finally after moving in a few months ago. This place is ALWAYS busy, which to me, means it's mighty tasty. I was greeted over the phone by Meredith, who was sooo nice and friendly! Her customer service was great but unfortunately , the food missed the seasoning mark this morning. I ordered a variety of things: The Apollo omelette, an order of French toast and the corned beef hash breakfast. On the plus side, the French toast was buttery and thick but nothing out of the ordinary. The omelette, grits and hash browns were absent of any type of seasoning (not salt and pepper, but actually seasonings), which was disappointing. I didn't taste any passion!"
"I've been here at least 50 times and it seems to slowly be going down hill. I'd like to chalk the issues up to being short staffed due to COVID, but it was more than that. The food was lukewarm and slow to come out. If my food i slow then it should at least be hot. Consistently, the service has been lackadaisical, but if you do get lucky enough to sit up stairs that does not seem to be the case."
"This place was the old prime bar. It's very spacious and our waitress was very nice. I ordered the Fabio meatball sub with sweet potato fries for lunch. The meal came out fast but my sandwich was luke warm. The meatballs were decent, nothing to get all crazy about like they make it using the chefs name. The sandwich was overall good because the meatballs were spiced nice but a little too soft for me probably from too much filling. My friend got the fish and chips and said it was good."
"Wanted to try a new spot during restaurant week and this menu caught my husband and I'd eye. We had a reservation but had to wait a bit outside which was not ideal but fine. Service was quick to start and we were able to put in our order, get our apps and entrees pretty quickly. The food was subpar. I did not like the meatballs at all, I'm not sure what it was but something tastes off. The arancini was okay. Both entrees, chicken parm and short rib ravioli were just okay but lacked flavor. After we were done eating it took about 20 minutes for the waitstaff to finally come and get our plates and bring dessert. I try not to judge restaurants during restaurant week as they are usually very busy but not excuse for bland food. We won't be back."
"Although I'm rating this place 3 stars, I did enjoy my dinner here. I think the main draw to this place is its atmosphere and friendly staff. It's not a fancy place but there was a fun New Orleans style band playing and the dance floor was jumping! I found the food to be mediocre. I had the gumbo and the New Orleans BBQ shrimp. Both were just meh. However, the Bread Pudding was fantastic! Best if shared with someone, in fact, it's served with 2 spoons."
"Why this place is so popular is beyond me. Tuesday lunchtime it was like a cattle call for this cash-cow business. I ordered a Queen Margherita Pizza that was more like a soft crusted flatbread. For $10.99 I received a portion that was no larger than a slice of $2.99 Pizza. Same goes for the salads, very small portions for lettuce and a few ingredients. That said, the food was decent and enjoyable. It was so busy I was surprised when my order arrived promptly. The poor employees were working like dogs to keep up with the volume of to-go orders, I felt sorry for them. One big plus, actual linen napkins which I appreciated. Worth a try but it will cost you $30 for lunch per couple with tip."
"Average food, inattentive bartender, not worth the price. Check out down the road for a better experience if you're solo or with a friend or two. This place is probably for you if you have a bigger group"
I had the choriZo and crab tacos and the misses had shrimp and halibut tacos.. the food lacked flavor. The rice was good the salad was meh. Food looks good but the look and taste don't go hand and hand.
"The wings came out hot with a rich and tangy sauce that was to die for. My fries were a disappointing, soggy mess, but I would still return. The wings are the highlight here. This place knows what it does well."
"Was very excited to have a new coffee place nearby. Ordered a latte. Didn't love my coffee, in fact, I took two sips in the parking lot and didn't finish it. It tasted burnt but not like burnt coffee. It had very little (weak) coffee flavor it just tasted burnt. Will try one more time and update otherwise I'll stick with my other local favorite coffee places. Space is not welcoming. It's not like a cozy cafe where you can sit and read a book while you enjoy your beverage. There's furniture for sale and a one seat hair salon tucked in the corner. However, owners son was a great guy! Very friendly, happy, and kind. He gets 5 for service!"
"Great pizza! Fun seating where you can see the kitchen. Unfortunately, staff wasn't very friendly. It's also pretty traditional so no ranch(for dipping) or trendy pizzas or cheese bread"
You kno. It was OK. Doesn't live up to the 5star hype. I ordered a side chili rellano. It comes enchilada style. Covered w enchilada sauce. I don't like wet rellanos. I'm glad I ordered it dry w sauce on the side. I did not like the enchilada sauce. Also ordered the 2 enchilada plate one chicken one shredded beef. Good basic enchilada but again wasn't impressed w the sauce. The small 2 oz guacamole I ordered was inundated w tomato chunks. Didn't care for that. The chips & salsa was ok. Had to salt them to taste good. Bathroom was clean. Restaurant is clean. Waiter wore mask
"I love the food here, but your bottomless system sucks. Bartender shoo'd me away from the bar because I went to inquire after my drink sat empty for over 20 mins. She was rude and the man who was behind the bar already was clearly bothered to follow me to the table to pour my drink. Maybe come up with a better system as this was a very poor experience and not my first time."
"Came here for a friend's birthday and was immediately impressed with how clean and modern the interior was. Definitely a bit more upscale than your typical hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. Altogether, 3 of us ordered 5 dishes (including 2 appetizers) : Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes, fatty beef sour radish soup, salt and pepper dried squid, and spicy lamb chops. Squid was an easy favorite, but I'm always a sucker for that chewy goodness. I have to give a special shout out to the radish soup. I would order this dish again just for the noodles. They had this almost firm-Jello-like consistency that gave the most perfect bite! And the broth itself was delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it. Wouldn't order the lamb chops again - meat was dry and it didn't go too well with the cumin marinade. A bit on the pricier end, but I think it's appropriate for the vibe and quality of food."
"Boba tea has been my latest obsession for the last month. As such, I've been making my rounds at various shops offering my new favorite delicacy. I've noticed most places add a TON of sugar and that's saying a lot coming from me as a dessert connoisseur. I've developed the habit of asking for less sugar as a result so today I ordered a medium milk tea with Oreo bits, less ice, less sugar and boba pearls. I liked the way they cooked their boba as it was softer than others I've had. On the other hand, the tea taste was very strong and I wasn't used to that. It seems they have a different tea to milk ratio than other places I've tried. At any rate, I may go back and try something different, definitely not so bad that I'd write it off. It's also a lot closer to me than other boba spots. One last thing I'll add is their menu is very confusing. It would benefit from some simplification."
"It took them 1 hour to serve the food. Just Pho and spring rolls. So for me, that was bad. Food is good"
"We came in today and had a pretty disappointing experience - we had a reservation, but had to wait an extra 20 minutes to be seated. They seemed a bit short staffed, so we brushed it off, but when our appetizer came, the crudité was covered in strands of someone's hair . Such a bummer."
"I had to get a bacon wrapped burrito, cuz.....it's a bacon wrapped burrito! It took awhile to get the burrito, which was fine. The burrito was large and heavy. Unfortunately, it just didn't taste that good, to me anyway. I think I liked the idea of bacon wrapped more than I actually liked the bacon wrapping. I would like to come back and try something else. If you're a big fan of bacon though, this may be the place for you!"
"Stopped here for lunch at 11:30. Lunch didn't start till noon. Service wasn't that great as the place was slow and the wait staff just hung around....... We left, so I can't give any better then 3 stars. Will try it next time. View is great."
It's a beautiful venue in a Mall higher end group of restaurants. The staff are great and dressed to the part. The pints are cold and the food was decent. The issue hurting The Pub like many places that have beers from other countries ... they are out of a bunch. Not the first Tavern/Pub that I have seen this. I will have to give it another stop in when I am back and see again.
"The food is good. We had the truffle fries and the bucatini, which was excellent. But, the alcohol prices are way too high. Macallum 12 is $17, wines are priced too high to order. So if you want to enjoy a drink or maybe two with your dinner, it will cost you."
"i had been driving by this place that seemed to appear out of nowhere for quite some time and finally decided to give it a shot. i picked a good time to go because there was no one inside. staff was friendly and took m y order right away. seemed to take a bit longer that i would expect considering i was the only person in the restaurant. i ordered the 15 piece soy garlick boneless wings and fries. not sure if my wings were done before the fries and sat for a few minutes but they werent piping hot like the fries. maybe because the sauce they use was cold or room temp, not sure. in any case, food was decent. the fires were really good. i need to go back to try more of the menu."
"Tried Mi Hacienda this weekend after seeing great reviews about it! I ordered Enchiladas Rojas with a Texas Margarita and my boyfriend got the Texaco Burrito(I think that's what it was called). Our waiter was very informative and shared his favorite dish on the menu. Everything tasted great, but I am rating average compared to other places. Would definitely go back for the quick service!! Yes we devoured the queso in the pic below :-)"
"1st of all, the service was phenomenal. Our waitress was fantastic. That's about it. Everything was way overcooked, the scallops were the consistency of chicken. Shrimp was shoe leather. Don't order the filet, order a sirloin, because that's what you're gonna get if you order a filet. The spinach tasted extremely fishy, which was weird..... The lamb was overcooked to the point of being inedible. Everything was ordered medium rare, and was cooked beyond well done. The garlic ranch dressing..... no garlic, extra sugar! Blech! But, it's extremely affordable, so what do you expect? Atmosphere was nice, and the service was good. We didn't complain, but they could tell we weren't happy and still comped the scallops, and desert. Again, the service was great.."
"This is an enjoyable breakfast spot, but I likely will not return often. Just generally speaking, I felt the food was a bit pricey - although I did enjoy the meal I had. The parking is also very sparse and hard to come by. Overall, if you eat here - you will enjoy your meal. The experience might not be up to standards, though"
"Oh Martha why :( the food is still delish but these price raises are so rude. Ex) $10 for the sunflower hummus when it was $9 last week...hummus was $6 in June folks. It's like we've jumped years into the future with this inflation. I understand there's been an ownership change but it hurts. I used to bring people here bragging about my fav restaurant & the reasonable prices, how they made me feel at home -like I too w my measly salary could join in on the fun. Additionally, what was so unique about the place were the rotating specials & appetizers (also reasonably priced) & they *just* added new specials after months. Martha was so cool, now like every other yuppy joint. *rant*"
"The last 2 times we were at Doc Fords has been disappointing. I realize with Covid staffing could be an issue but don't accept reservations then. Three days ago I made reservations for lunch for 4 today. I said we'd like to be outside, ground level because we will be bringing two dogs. We arrived right on time and we were told to wait for a text. We waited 10 minutes then I was notified our table was ready. The hostess took us to a patio table. I said we have two dogs, she said oh I'll have to talk to the Mgr about you sitting with dogs on the patio.. I said we want to sit ground level, I mentioned that when I made my reservations. She seemed frustrated with me and told me to wait. She never came back. Meanwhile I had my husband go inside to the hostess desk to see what he could do. They finally sat us outside, ground level. Our server was not friendly at all, the food was marginal at best. A very disappointing experience."
I've been a customers of P. J. Whelihan's for many years. There have been good experiences and not so good ones. Last night was a good one. Our server was quick and efficient. I had a speciality drink which was delicious. Cupid's kiss. I took a photo of it so I can continue to order it in the future. The wings were crispy last night with just the right amount of sauce. I love the Buffalo chicken salad with hot wing nuggets. It's one of the better Buffalo salads in the area. The pj fries are always a hit with the warm cheese sauce.
Place looks amazing. We were excited to eat here on NYE and made a 8:00 reservation through Open Table for our party of 8. We showed up at 6:30 because we were hungry and wanted to eat earlier. Place was empty. Hostess says they had staff issues and only had pizzas available. We left because some of our party wanted the pasta. My only reason for posting is I never got an alert saying they had a limited menu. A heads up would have been nice on NYE. We made a reservation so we wouldn't have to search all over for a place which is what ended up happening.
"I was pretty disappointed by this place. Based on reviews, I expected that nice trendy foodie stuff. Unfortunately it was mediocre. Decent food. The Mac was the best part of it. The chicken for chicken and waffles was weird and had some gooey discoloration inside. We opted not to eat it. The waffle was meh. The maple bacon Brussels sprouts were undercooked and swimming in watery syrup. Would only come here again because the mac n cheese was a nice hefty portion and really creamy (the way I like it)."
"Over priced gnocchi dish. Very small portion, barely covered the small pasta bowl it was in. There was maybe 15 very small gnocchI. For $ 23.00 no side dish, bread or salad included. Also the other dish we got was the steak with large beans. Steak was average beans were hard again over priced $30.00"
"Service was great! Atmosphere was good, we ordered the crab cakes to start and they were really good! For our entrees we ordered the Taste of New Orleans, which came out almost cold, like yesterdays food reheated in a microwave. Did not taste fresh at all. We also had the blackened Bayou Duck, which was good nothing over the top spectacular but good. It came with a side of jambalaya that was also cold and not fresh. Overall it was an okay spot, but we wouldn't visit again."
"Ordered through DoorDash. It was quickly ready and delivered. We ordered a Sierra Mist but received a Pepsi, assume they were out. No sauce came with the garlic parm breadsticks. They were mostly dry and unlike what I expected. Pizza was overall good."
The food and service is always great. My number one complaint is the drive through. The line is always long and hangs out into traffic. I know that's not DD's fault for such a crappy road to be on and people are sooooo impatient. But I'm happy to get my sweet tea at DD!
"I was underwhelmed with my meal. I ordered the chicken fried chicken. The portion was quite small with barely any chicken and tasteless, and the stuffing was very dry. The waitress was very nice and attentive."
"I typically receive good food/service when I've visited LongHorn in the past and this day I didn't think I'd have any issues. We were greeted and immediately seated and our server Sarah soon came over to greet us and take our drink orders. She was very patient, attentive, and friendly. Ordered were placed, received our bread, then appetizers and then our meal. I asked for my steak to be medium well and instead received a very well done steak. So much so that the other side of the steak (part that was plate down) was burnt and the part that was plate up was burnt as well but not that bad. I was eating charred meat. Informed our server who was very apologetic and said I could send it back (something I don't like to do at all and didn't). She took my plate and soon returned and said she took my entire meal off the bill. I was thankful for her support and made sure she got a lil extra tip on top of the 20%. Everything else with our meal was good and tasty. Oh the one thing I didn't care for was the French Onion soup. The cheese on top was super chewy. So much so that I thought I had gum in my mouth."
"Pizza here is OK. Nothing special but fills you up. But never order pizza here on Grubhub. You might get it the next day. For the second time, big delay after ordering pizza, last night so much that when I called--an hour + later, they hadn't even started the order (even tho the GH app said driver would be there in 10 min. When I asked to cancel they said I would have to go thru Grubhub to do that. And not a hint of an apology. This is a challenging time for restaurants, I get it, but if so, possibly they should stop taking orders thru GH or DD if they can't be sent out in a reasonable time frame."
"Hate to say it but I don't understand what all of the hype is about! Was expecting long lines and crowds but ended up getting a table in the back room in the apartment complex lobby. Tried to order online with the QR code but it kept giving me an error that items in my cart were no longer available, but not specifying which items, so I ended up waiting in line to order anyway. No one in my group liked the grilled cheese Jerusalem bagel. One compared it to frozen Ellio's pizza- and they weren't wrong- yikes. The avocado kubaneh toast was good, but nothing special beyond your average avocado toast. The pistachio sticky bun was by far the stand out item, but definitely doesn't compare to the pastries at Suraya. I don't drink coffee but others in the group strongly disliked theirs. My Bloody Mary was horrible, one of the worst I've had. The items were delivered to the table sporadically with huge gaps of time in between. For example, we ordered 2 sticky buns and one came out right away and the other came out after we finished everything and were packing up to leave. Overall, a big ol' disappointment."
"We have been to several glory days grills around the area. This is our first visit to this one located on route 54. We ordered the slam dunk pretzels and while the cheese sauce was very good the pretzels had an older tasting oil on them and we did not finish them. We also ordered eight wings with honey barbecue which were fine and a chicken tender platter which was very good. Service was average. As for the location itself, We were surprised that it was not more busy on Saturday. I have a feeling there's a reason that is now I'm not sure why. All in all not a bad location but certainly not the best either."
Friendly service The food is fine (but not super ) Price is pretty affordable You have to find a parking space in the street ( no private parking lot)
"Seemed like a really cool place so we had to check it out; Housed in an old church, we were hoping for some heavenly delicious food but were disappointed that it wasn't quite out of the world. The entrance is a bit weird where there's a small foyer with a step that blocks the view to the rest of the place so you could be standing in there and unless the maitre'd is at their podium they can't see you. They seemed understaffed with the server also acting as a hostess. Started with the crawfish hushpuppies, which had a nice sauce with it; they were a bit salty but the pickled red onion and sauce helped to balance them. I got the market fish, which honestly I was pretty disappointed about. There was was too much lentils with it, and the fish was overseasoned and very salty. The salad on top was nice to help freshen up the fish but it needed more, and I only ate about 1/2 of the lentils; they ironically didn't taste like much."
"Came here in a hurry to grab something to eat. Unfortunately they were severely understaffed with only two waiters to serve a holiday rush of customers. We had to seat ourselves and our table with still dirty. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and lovely despite the stress he was under. The food though- not the best. Crab cakes were overly salted, dry, and not as good as others I've had. Hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise but more like melted cheese. Grits were sooo bland I had to add numerous condiments. I tried a few things from my friend's plates including their omelettes, which were also bland. Truthfully, I would give this place 2 stars if it wasn't for our great waiter and the cheap prices. 2 for 1 mimosas was also a steal."
"This place has such a fun vibe! Some friends and I stopped in here for lunch and drinks, and got in right before the lunch rush. Our entrees included Gumbo, Crawfish Pie, and Shrimp PoBoys; all 3 were great. Pictured below is the gumbo. If you're in the mood to drink, this place serves a delicious Hurricane. It certainly checked all the boxes! This place is definitely a fun spot to come and enjoy some good eats and beverages at!"
"It wasn't what I expected I might go back if someone asked or wanted to meet here it was good though. The place wasn't what I expected I'm always used to seeing a lot of decoration indoor and stuff like that when I looked it upIt looked very different than when I arrived. We went inside it was really packed.Will they get a nice spot though it wasn't close to the doors that's what made it nice but right next to the bathrooms. We are happy to see the food, it was so good and we wanted to get the beef shank but they ran out. I think I might go back if someone recommended or was close today at one to go to the meet up and eat. Food was delicious I wait or even brought us some of the food that was sold out that's customer service."
So we have been going to this place a couple years now. I first fell in love with the fried pork egg rolls they are my favorite in town still! The brisket is cooked well but the broth is sweeter then I like . I'm having a hard time justifying $15.50 for a bowl of pho I first loved pho because it was economical but this place has changed with all the upgrades they want to increase prices. Maybe we only go on slow days but I never see many others in there maybe they have caught on too. The prices went up twice the last few times I've been there. Since I can get pretty decent pho elsewhere I can no longer justify the prices . Service is good. Food was excellent prices are more than they should be for this area and because there is competition near by. Thanks for the good food and good luck!
"The food was very good and our waitress was kind. However i'm pretty sure my entire family has food poisoning from this place. My husband has uncontrollable bowel movements and my daughter and I both have awful stomach aches. I feel like my appendix has exploded. Please be cautious when you go here. Not to mention when they messed up my son's order, they were very rude about remaking it even though i paid $8 for a bag of fritos with some beef in it. I'm sure it was not difficult to make."
"Service is friendly but definitely not fast. A very casual pace at this restaurant. There were only two other people dining, or should I say waiting for their food, in the restaurant but still service was extremely slow. My flight was leaving out of gate A-17 right next door so I was prepared to leave without food if my flight boarded before my food was ready. The menu is rather limited and they were out of some things. I ordered a grilled cheese and pickle chips after they were out of my first choice. The server kept me updated on the status of my order, which I appreciated. Food is good but definitely not a place to eat if you don't have extra time. The atmosphere here is slow and casual which isn't as good fit for an airport restaurant. I took my food to go and the server brought it out just seconds before I had to board, so it worked out. My grilled cheese was burned but the fries were good. Probably won't attempt to dine here again unless I have time to spare."
The food was good they could have toasted the Buns the music videos amazing Tevin Campbell Jodeci Boyz II Men
"so, I expect my fish and chips to be greasy, but this took it to a level I've never seen before. they have managed to transform a potato into a sponge... what has science done? not really my thing but I'm sure someone loves it. breading was kind of dull and outside is very lightly salted. I'd eat here again but probably wouldn't get the potatoes"
"I came here originally in 2014 and had the best chicken sandwhich ever. It's no longer on the menu so I tried something new, the bru burger. Your standard bacon cheeseburger. It was the day before the CFP championship game so It was packed so that's find. We got seated fairly quickly and ordered food and drinks. Our food eventually came. My burger was room temperature. Cheese was congealed. Bottom of the bag lettuce, bun was room temp. I sent the burger back, a dream hour and fries came out about 10 minutes later. The burger was hot, not warm but hot. However, It lacked any type of flavor. It was obviously a pre made/frozen patty. All of our burgers were the same size, temperature (despite ordered different) and same grill marks. It's hard to think of a place claiming gourmet burgers serving pre made Patties. I took about 3 bites and It never got vetted. I'm giving 3 stars because the wait staff was awesome and the peach white chelate bread pudding was amazing!"
After dining here I remember why I stopped going. The appetizer was really good and it was crab stuffed shrimp Rangoon. I liked those a lot. The salad was Just ok. I had a Cesar and they were several wilted and brown leaves. But minus those it tasted OK. I also had create your own feast and had the bay scallops oven fried and salmon grilled with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes and the salmon were good but the scallops did not taste great and were tiny ones which it did not mention on the menu. Overall it was OK but for the price it wasn't worth it. The waiter was really good and very attentive. He made the experience better.
In town looking for a hot ramen place for dinner because of a rainy day. Only 2 places opened due to holiday week. Sachi offered more menu selection so we picked this place over the other ramen place. Both ramen are served very hot so it's a good choice of hot food in a rainy day.
"Three stars is generous for our experience and I'm mostly putting that because it is a pleasant, lively environment, the waitress was nice and they had Zombie Dust on tap. The service was slow because she had too many tables. Would not return for the food. Had the spinach and artichoke dip: few artichokes, practically no discernible spinach, very heavy mayonnaise texture and inadequate quantity of chips which oddly were dusted in chili powder. The nut and fruit salad had no nuts. My salad greens were not at all fresh, so I spent the meal picking slimy bits out and setting them to the side. Hubby had ""no complaints"" about the tenderloin sandwich. Cucumbers in the coleslaw was a pleasant surprise."
"Staff very friendly we were greeted quickly the place is very clean and well appointed with tables and booths, outdoor seating is available. I went there for the Meatball Burrito I saw them detail on the news one day it looked appealing however I was disappointed with the taste ( like canned spag sauce) very little meatballs. Was it okay yes -just okay would I order again no. Salad we had a power bowl salad with Chicken that was awesome. If in a hurry good place to go but I would not go out of my way eat there."
"Good little spot! It's a little dingy but that seems to be the norm for the area. Service isn't great, but hey, they brought the food! The butter chicken was good. They do more of a shredded chicken style as opposed to chunks but the sauce was delicious. That's my sons go to and he rather enjoyed it. The goat vindaloo was a bit bland but and didn't have any potatoes but was still decent. I loved the nana and only wish it was hot and that it came out before we were halfway through our meal. It was fluffy in the edges and crispy on the bottom with great seasoning. The vegetable samosa was probably some of the best I've had and recommend trying that to start you'd meal."
"Upon my arrival I was not greeted at all. They had 2 ladies standing in the back of the restaurant just looking at everyone coming in. Never said a word to be and another lady that walked in. Then 2 more ladies came from the back kitchen and didn't otter a word neither. Never said someone is gonna be with you, how can I help you? NOTHING! As if I wasn't even standing there. The young that handle takeout orders finally arrived and didn't say she was sorry for my wait. Now on to the food. The wing was very bland, and tough. They had VERY little flavor at at. I don't know what the toughest was about. But they were hard to chew and pull. I don't now if they were under cooked or what. The onion rings were on the burnt side. It's been awhile since I've been to this particular location and now I see why. Because it will be awhile before I return again"
"The restaurant was pretty empty, and We were immediately seated upon arrival. Our server was nice and personable. We started with the fried biscuits and they were hot and delicious. The service (food prep) was slow. I ordered the meat lovers skillet with French toast. The skillet was delicious, but Almost cold. The French toast was just awful. I hope that it was just a bad day, because I should've asked for a refund. The French toast tasted like cooked bread, without any flavor. I had my husband take a taste as well, and he was shocked and felt the same way . My husband ordered the same (meat lovers) skillet but with scrambled eggs, and pancakes. He wasn't a fan of the pancakes, but enjoyed the skillet. Overall, I'd try this out place again, just for the fried biscuits and possibly the skillet. Again, we had a very friendly server! 5 stars for the server!"
"Went here for dinner while on vacation in Santa Barbara, and loved the location but did not love the experience as much. The table we were seated at had crumbs all over each chair. We had to ask our waiter for utensils twice while our appetizers got cold. They no longer serve lobster but it's still on the menu. They were also out of two other types of fish entrees. The peppered red snapper was pretty good, however it came with an overwhelming amount of potatoes. The Gamelli pasta was a simple yet good choice. The octopus was a very good appetizer with great sauce."
Went here on Christmas Day for some good chow. DONT COME HERE ON CHRISTMAS. waited 2 hours for mediocre at best food when they told me the wait was 20-40 minutes. Food was ok but was not even worth the 20-40 minutes much less the 2 hours. They were disorganized and they lied about the wait time over the phone and in person. They had no organization as to the order in which the food was made.
"Dined here by myself last night and it was Ok, but not great. The front of the restaurant is piled up with used boxes and tables with chairs piled up on them, such that I wasn't sure if it was open or open just for take out. When I peeked around the corner I could see that there were about a dozen tables and just one was occupied. Perhaps the owners should clean up the place and take a little pride of ownership. I ordered a side salad and a bowl of #12 Pho. The salad consisted of iceberg lettuce, and iceberg lettuce. Nothing else. I don't believe there was any dressing on it either but if there was it had no taste. As for the Pho, was somewhat tasty but it was served to me just barely lukewarm, not hot as I would expect a hearty soup with noodles to be served. I sent it back and ask them to please warm it up for a few minutes. Now...I am an experienced Vietnamese food eater, (which is why I chose this restaurant), but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. My experience here was subject to the fact that I was very hungry having spent the day traveling from the East Coast. The service was average--they seemed overwhelmed filling take-out orders. Would I go back? Hmmmm. I'll keep searching."
"The service was good, the prices are reasonable, but the food was just so-so. I'd order the enchiladas again, but the rice was dry. My companions ordered the chimichanga and burrito grande. The burrito grade was, well, grande! Massive. But he said it was delicious, and he'd definitely order it again. The chips were good, but the salsa was just ""eh"". We like spicy. The spicier the better, and this was just typical, restaurant-grade. Nothing to write home about."
"Good food with a lousy service! We dined outside due to COVID reasons. Once seated it took 20 mins to just get water, the restaurant wasn't even at 50% capacity. The waitress was like I don't care. We asked a question about kids menu which she said I will check with the chef, guess what? 20 more mins without any reply with the same waitress serving other tables. We ordered chorisso stuffed chicken, truffled gnocchi and saffron salmon, all were quite good. Giving a 3 star for the good food but lousy service."
"The bakery is excellent, however the debit swipe machines prompt for gratuity. I did not tip and got attitude from girl up front. Sorry, but you were just packing one lemon bar to go. Get over yourself."
"Decent dining experience with outrageous prices. We tried a variety of items. Some were excellent like the bib lettuce, the bone marrow and the blue crab dumplings. The skirt steak and the duck breast arrived cold, so perhaps they could have been more impressive had they been served at the right temperature. The hot pot was good, but it was a very small portion. Desserts and drinks were just ok. Wine list was lacking good mid price range bottles."
Uh oh! What happened Pia's? Once upon a time you were amazing. Loved your place. Yet I think someone in the kitchen now owns stock in a salt company. I was not able to eat my entree due to way too much salt. This too much salt thing has been going on for a few weeks. Once it gets fixed I'd like to return. Sweet waitress. Cute place.
This location on Virginia and Neil rd is closed pile of boxes kitchen and dining room lights are turned off
"I pass this place all the time and I decided to give it a try today, bad idea, I walked in and had to stand there for a few min because the sign says to wait to be seated, there were only 2 tables being occupied, and one waitress that needs a class in customer service, she acted like she had an attitude when she seated me,. I decided what I wanted to eat and had to sit there another 10-15 min before she came and took my order, she brings me my food, but I had no silverware, so I had to wait till she brought my silverware, the food was horrible I have never seen egg drip soup so thick and disgusting, it literally looked like snot with peas in it, the rice was tasteless, and the sweet and sour chicken had no taste. So needless to say I left just as hungry as I did when I walked in. I will never patronize Sky Dragon ever again."
Amazing food every time. The only thing is I wish they would enforce social distancing again because it sucks to have someone cough on you mid pandemic trying to wait for your cheesesteak. Ordering system is great and cash only so be prepared.
"Not sure why all the bad reviews. We've been ordering take out from here weekly for nearly four years and have few to no complaints. The pizza is consistently fresh, hot, and good. From time to time we also get the boneless wings and found them to be tasty. We order online, and the pizza is always ready by the time we reach the store. This locations has a pick up window and u can pay on line so make it extremely awesome and save specially during the pandemic before vaccines. is important to mention the people at the pick up window re always super nice never have any problems, no attitude and no drama. Has there been some mess ups? Of course. A couple of pizzas came out undercooked, or they get an order wrong. These are a rarity given the frequency of our orders but a quick call to the manager and they fix the problem right away either with re-macking the pizza or giving a credit for next order. The important thing is they have always made it right. Not everyone like Pizza Hut pizza, but that's a personal preference. for us this location is and always be our Pizza Friday and yes we obviously like it! I'm giving 4 stars because there is always improve so when the time comes will give the 5 star."
"I go to the eegees on st marys maybe twice a week or so. They're great there. The employees are friendly. The food is almost always on point. But there have been a few times where they've messed it up- but when I go back they fix it with a smile. Their fries are always made to order so they're always fresh. I just wish they'd even out their fizz drinks, about half the time you only get like a squirt of soda. And it would be cool if they had more flavors of their slushees. But the restaurant is super clean, as well as the bathrooms, you can see right into the kitchen and see it's just as clean- all their employees wear masks too."
"I've been here about 10 times. Every single time I've been here the staff seems to be upset with my presence. No matter who I'm with or how I am. Every time since day one. Even the waitresses that are completely fake nice, you can tell they are secretly plotting your death. Food is pretty good although a bit overpriced in my opinion. Atmosphere is all right. Beer- eh. Pretty loud in there too. like they could use some sound baffling. Props on having shuffle board and pool. My least favorite part of this place is the stuffed bear. Not because of animal rights or anything but because it's completely in the way and I bump into it every time I go to the bathroom. Pretty gross cause I'm sure everyone else does it too. Covid super spreader right there. All this being said I'll probably definitely go back. But maybe in a few months."
"I'm from ND but my friend that lives here said we had go here for supper cause it was so good, she was not wrong!! My food was so amazing (I got something with Bolognese) and she loved hers too (chicken Marsala)! The only problems I had was it was pretty cramped in there and our waiter was in such a hurry it kind of gave us anxiety! Would recommend though!!"
"2nd visit. First was a Yelp sponsored event. The $5.00 (small pitcher) before 5 is a definite pull for me. I tried the tomato soup this visit. Very good. Not like the milk based I grew up with back east. More of a Mediterranean style which I now prefer. Was not aware you can order individual board items, $4 ea, we ordered artichoke toast great, and second time ordering the Tuna sandwich w chips. My only criticism is the same Tuna w chips we ordered at the Yelp event was ""stuffed "" w tuna and piled high w chips. Not so today. Lots of bread and few chips to share. Likely to return for $5 before 5 and homemade soups."
"This is a new Burmese/Thai/sushi restaurant on Northside of town across from North Central high-school. Cute little restaurant, clean, very atune service. Food was good. Got fried spring rolls, steamed chicken dumplings, pad ka prao minced chicken, and Burmese curry noodle soup. The soup was certainly the highlight of the meal. Very similar ingredients to a kao soi but no crunchy rice noodles and a thinner, ""soupier"" broth. Reminded me of consistency of a Tom kha soup. It was exceptional. The pad ka prao is sliced meat here but they made it thai style by request by mincing meat. The entree comes with side of jasmine rice topped with fried egg. The stir fry was good, not overly sweet or overly basil flavored. It is in the middle of pack as far as this particular dish goes around indy metro. The spring rolls and dumplings were both fair as well. Definitely will be back to try more entrees, menu items to gather better opinion. Great to have another thai spot in metro."
"Good late night stop. Clean and efficient, we got a couple rolls, they weren't the best but def ok for the convenience of location. Kinda pricey, but again, very convenient. I think they have karaoke some nights as well"
Very beautiful restaurant. It's pretty much an upscale pho restaurant. The pho was actually pretty good for a suburban area. A great place to get pho if you don't want to drive to Philly and deal with the vaccine mandate or just don't want to go to Philly in general. Probably the best authentic pho I had outside of Philly. They're generous with their meats and noodles. The broth was a little lacking to me but nothing a little bit of fish sauce and hoisin/sriracha couldn't fix. I would also recommend their summer rolls. It was so fresh and now those were the best summer rolls I've ever had. I would definitely come back for them! I didn't try their Japanese cuisine but it was pretty much just sushi. A little bit on the pricey side but they have uni and toro! Now that's legit. Try them out if you like pho and sushi
Always fresh and homemade items on the menu daily reminds you of that home cook meal your mom would make!
"Not bad for a sports bar. It's loud in here but that's warranted. The food was pretty good can't even front. I wasn't expecting it to be honestly but it was! Hubby got a burger and I got a chicken sandwich. We got wings for starters. He also got some chili, which he said was awesome. Didn't get to take pics of the wings cuz we gobbled them up before I thought about my camera lol will definitely be back to grab some beers and possibly watch a game :)"
The food here is excellent. Food is priced well. The Eggs Benedict and the Kitchen Sink were incredible. I enjoyed the food so much here and well-cooked. The food was fantastic but has a small portion. I highly recommend this place and will continue to go back.
"While there is no doubt this is some of the best pizza in town, the lines and the wait are brutal. I have ordered from here three times and every time it took 30/40 minutes longer than I was told over the phone."
holy moly the raviolis taste like fingerolis. CORRECTION: in case it wasn't clear Yelp HQ I did NOT enjoy my ravioli at the Olive Garden in Willow Grove and the only saving grace of the experience was the fact that they DID taste like fingers :)
I've been trying to make my way here since I first saw the king cake beignet on Instagram. I'm happy this place did not disappoint. It was very busy and we barely found a seat. Please keep in mind there is no wait staff. You have to order at the bar. I had the panini which came with truffle fries. The prosciutto had a strong taste which I personally did not care for but if you like prosciutto I'm sure this sandwich would work you. The truffle fries were delicious. I ate them all and they were cold! The king cake beignet had the traditional beignet dough flavor with a sweet glaze. The filling tasted of cream cheese and walnuts. I tried the queso and was surprised it tasted so freshly made. The flatbread was amazing. I'll get it next time I go. I also want to try the beignet flight. This place would make for a cute date.
"The place is nice, The servers treat you so kindly, I felt like I was a queen that's how nice they are. All in all, this is a good waffle house!"
Only been for takeout a handful of times but the good is always hot and fresh. Chicken is cooked well and dish is packed with flavor. Only warning is the food is quite spicy so if you don't have a high spice tolerance just opt for medium or mild.
"We really liked this place. You choose which seafood to have steamed in a bag, and what kinds of sauces. It can be pricey if you choose lobster or king crab, but you can keep the cost down with cheaper but yummy options. We had fun and will go back. The Cajun spice was good. I will probably just do garlic sauce next time. I'm allergic to shrimp and was happy that I didn't have a reaction when I just ordered clams and muscles. Over all, it's fun to put on a bib and get buttery with your food:)"
This cafe was okay. Their cheese grits were great. The breakfast sandwich and boudin omelette were meh. I'd only eat there again if it was the only place we could get into (which is why we ate there the first time). Service was good!
"My fiancé and I dined here for a date night. The atmosphere is very neat. It is a bit rambunctious due to the kitchen being open, but it creates a very unique dining experience and ambiance for diners. We ordered a vodka lemon martini, which was excellent. For dinner, we ordered Caesar salad, which was a perfect compliment to my ribeye, and my fiancé's chicken Parmesan. My ribeye was ordered medium rare, and cooked to the correct temperature. It did lack flavor, but it was a solid steak--nothing too excellent but satisfying. My fiancés chicken parm was excellent, unfortunately it was probably better than my steak, but a knockout for the menu for sure! Service was sufficient, but not excellent due to them being busy, totally understandable. This is a solid restaurant if in the area."
"Solid Tex-Mex food. Decent prices. Saved us during a stint at the beginning of May 2020. Definitely order the Wet Burritos here. Quite good. I'm not a huge burrito fan, but dang these were stick to your ribs good (and so filling my husband couldn't even finish it)."
"My go to spot when I am craving Poke. The atmosphere is nice and clean and the workers are very fun and energetic. I love the variety and amount of options they provide as well as their expansive Hawaiian inspired menu. The portions are just right and the flavors are amazing. One downside is depending on when you go in the fish isn't always fresh, but this is a somewhat rare occurence."
"We rolled into Clearwater in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the weekend of the outback bowl! Tons of Razorbacks and Nittany Lions everywhere in the street and on the beach it was great to see the crowds enjoying the beautiful Florida weather. This location of the clear sky has been a favorite of ours for years because it's steps away from the public access to the beach. After a nice long walk on the beach my husband and I slipped into a beautiful table outside just in time for the happy hour half-price drinks who doesn't love it! We ordered fried grouper bites excellent, as well goat cheese portobello mushroom flatbread a little bit more of a cracker and too crispy for me wouldn't get it next time but very tasty. My husband had the grill triggerfish sandwich which was delicious and of course you know you just need a few extra things so we took home a burger that's a crowdpleaser all the time. Service is great outdoor people watching excellent and the food is is good. Live music Sunday - steel drum solo man with great rhythm and a great singing voice. Happy hour half price drinks only Monday thru Friday but $2 off on Sunday! The restaurant has eco friendly straws if you must use one."
"This fun shop had good seating, live music on a Saturday, and great cappuccino. Would have easily given 5 stars if we had been acknowledged by the barista, been asked to wait as he was obviously short staffed or maybe even received a smile. I would go back because I like the name, but the coffee is good too."
"Nice vibe and good food, service was fast. I was having Creole food for first time, while it was good, it will not be on top of my list. Expect to be surprised by the taste. The portions are small so pls order side dishes and appetizers. Good tropical daiquiris which are a must."
"The food was absolutely delicious. The only bummer was finding out the injera is made from only part teff flour, because im gluten free"
"Overall good food. The pizza was good, had a homemade taste and the wings are great. The garlic bread was burnt and terrible though and we weren't refunded for it, but the waitress and staff was friendly."
"I've been coming to this quaint little restaurant in Safety Harbor for over 10 years. Another ""go to"" place for me. Great menu variety - definitely something for everyone, tots of beers on tap and great service. I always go for the Fried Green Tomatoes - just delicious. It's usually my spot for a light lunch of assorted appetizers after a long walk between parks. Mostly all outdoor seating- open air - sun and shade it's a great place to unwind and take in the relaxing vibes of Safety Harbor!"
"A cute little space in the CBD. Outdoor seating was available, and looked very nice, but it was too cold to sit outside. Service was right on top of our needs, making sure our drinks and water never were empty. Appetizers (shareables) were good portion sized, the meals were very good."
"LOVE the pesto, always hits the spot for pasta cravings when in SB! Quick, easy, and cheap. Love you presto!"
"This place is always very consistent with their food and the service. The location is great...(a few steps outside the Quarter.) We started with the tuna tataki, then had some rolls and split everything. We were very happy with the food selections that we made. We will go back again soon."
"Was looking for somewhere close to work to get food from. Delivery here through DoorDash was going to be $23 just for a $12 burger so I decided to just go get it. Aside from the gluten free bread tasting like a sponge, everything was fine;"
"went to the bar and got the garden of greens drink with rum. very yummy, only taking away one star because it was $12. i like the atmosphere here and the bartender was very friendly!"
"Reluctantly tried this today, despite the rating. The gentleman that was serving was in on the ball and friendly. (Hard to find in today's labor pool.). Service was quick for only having one person serving. I did the triple entree, and was pleasantly surprised. The orange sesame chicken was cooked perfectly and delicious. Green beans were crisp and well seasoned. I tried the spicy potatoes, which were delicious. My only reason for the 4-star rating was the potatoes. Had they been cooked a little softer to be able to cut wit plastic ware or maybe just cubed or even cut to half the size for easier eating, that would have pushed the 5th star. Glad I stopped here for lunch while in the mall."
"If you've ever enjoyed Paradise bakery (rip), this is absolutely the place to go. Their tomato soup is AMAZING. I go here just for the soup! Outside of that, their customer service is good. They have fantastic soups & salads and everything comes with a cute little croissant. Try this place out!"
"Very good, quick service, amazing food. Chips and salsa were literally the best I've had anywhere. Would recommend. Just wish they had frozen margs, hopefully they add that."
"I was down for the count, and had been making my rounds getting different kinds of soup.. it was Pho's turn... I actually thought this was the place I normally go to but apparently it was not... I was not at all disappointed tho... I got the brisket & ribeye pho and it was delicious... the broth is every so slightly sweet but also peppery it was right on point with what I needed in the moment. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can see why the reviews are all positive. I now have an additional place to get great Pho... I'm looking forward to trying other menu items."
Not bad. We had the Cuban pollo platter which was very tasty. The chicken breast was small and dry but the flavor- just the right amount and combo of spices - was good. The beans and rice were excellent and the maduros were absolutely addicting. It gets a minus one star for uncomfortable seating inside and out; and dirty tables and floors.
Food was very good and the view was fantastic. We sat outside for the kite festival and enjoyed ourselves. Our waiters name was Devon who was very friendly and attentive. They have valet parking and let us keep our car beyond the 2 hour request. I am not giving this 5 stars because of the front reception staff. We weee told we didn't need a reservation for lunch to just come back to the desk to be seated (we had 45 minutes till lunch service). When we did my husband was greeted by a rude young man who said they weren't seated. My husband explained and ultimately requested the manager who was pleasant and seated us. Overall good experience except for the hic
Great outside dining area. We were there on a Sunday for a Sunday brunch which their brunch menu is somewhat limited. The food was good. I had the Salmon bowl and the salmon was cooked perfectly. My wife did have the bottomless Mimosas. Prices are reasonable.
"I love going to this place, the views are pretty awesome. The food is good, especially the blue cheese chips are so amazing. Also the sweet tea is the best sweet tea I've ever had. The service was actually pretty good for us each time we went. I tried before the boneless wings and the cheese burger, they were both pretty mediocre. However I'd still keep going back."
"Some of the best Jamaican food out here and trust me when I say that's a HARD find. My go to is stew chicken all the time but TODAY?! Something about todays plate that had every one attempting to violate my ""get six feet"" order. It was BUSSIN BUSSIN! And the price ain't too shabby for the amount to get! Of course ima order again duhhhh! Lol"
"Our server Sarah was amazing! We had oysters on half shell, hush puppies, grouper bites. All was very good. Fun and casual atmosphere with TVs!"
"Was seated by the door- not my fancy, so I asked to move. It was no problem!! My server asked all the right questions that fit with my group dynamic - checked on my at least four times during the meal - he was just ""all over it"" with all his guests - He had the Perfect disposition for his job! I ordered the regular ribeye but asked to have it fire grilled. It was cooked just as I like it - med rare and was just delicious. I added mushrooms and onions , which I love and they were also cooked well. Sides were cooked perfectly - sweet potato and garlic butter asparagus It was an overall really good experience."
"The food quality was a-1 as far as the meats Very good The pancake was the best one i had here in stlouis. I am an experienced kbbq eater and the server was treating me as if it was my first time not bringing out any lettuce , jalapeños , garlic and what not. The portions wasn't as much as i thought honestly should of gotten the large"
"We were able to make reservations for New Years Eve which was such a nice treat since most big events in the city were cancelled. The staff was very welcoming and seated us about 10 minutes after our reservation time (not bad considering it was very busy!) Our order was taken quickly and the server took care of our wine (no corking fee...bonus!) Our four course meal was up charged to $85pp because of the holiday. It took a while to get each course, however I believe it was because the restaurant was rather busy. The burrata was good, not great. It had a caprese style to it, so maybe my personal preference but I didn't love. The gnocci was good, not great. A little too oily for my preference. My third course was another pasta option which was good but not bursting with flavor. When it came time for dessert, it had been over two hours since we started to eat so we decided to take it home. I got the lemon blueberry oil cake and it was delicious! Overall our experience was good not great. I think the $85pp up charge was a bit of a turnoff, however it was NYE so that is to be expected. The food wasn't amazing but it was still good! Our servers and staff were all wonderful and the ambiance of the restaurant was very cute! Would I go back? Maybe! Just not for an $85 pre fixe meal."
Vibe is amazing. Not a long wait time. Food was great but wish there was a larger list of options on menu.
Pretty decent. I want to give only 3 stars but something more like 3 and half would be more appropriate. The food has potential to be so delicious but I'm not sure if we came on an off day but everything was kind of lacking flavor. The mimosas were okay. I think I just personally prefer OJ. The beni could've been good if the asparagus was cook a bit more and the hollandaise had just a touch more flavor. The poutine was our favorite thing; could use a bit more of the gravy but still delicious. I would like to return some day for a second chance.
"When you wake up groggy from a night of fighting with electrical issues, you want breakfast that can be delivered quick and be hearty. Well, I found it with Wendy's yesterday. Through their magical app, where you can also get points for freebies later, I placed the order for the fam, it gets dispatched to the store, and DoorDash handles the logistics. I was lucky enough to not only have a Dasher close by for immediate pickup, the order was correct, and most importantly HOT!!!! This store goes through its pains of staffing and sometimes does not always read notes in full. The only reason I'm giving 4-stars this go around is a miss on some order notes. When someone requests coffee with cream and sugar, sugar is not equal and sweet & low; both of which not the best for the body. Other than that the cold brew was amazing!!! Thanks for great food and a great recharge at an affordable value and was worth every bit of it and delivered in just about 25-30 minutes time. Can't wait to order again soon!!!"
"My first time visiting the P&P on Grant after being a loyal Campbell Ave customer. I don't know if it's the 'state of things' or what, and it's subtle but still, I noticed corners cut. I've ordered the everything croissant sammie, like, every time I come. It's the best. And I know what it COULD be. And this one, well, WASN'T. This time it seemed like there's less 'everything' on the croissant, the whole thing wasn't really warm, the eggs were weird flat scrambled patties, the cheese wasn't exactly melted, and the croissant itself wasn't as fluffy and awesome. The crispy potatoes were mostly whole. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were there. But it wasn't the same. If this is what it's going to be like from now on I'll be sad. Still top notch French 75s though!"
Excellent food best brunch in town Wish there was more of a seasonal variety Love they are in the Wesley chapel area and are close to shopping
"Frank's closed for good... Out of Business. Sad. New restaurant and bar scheduled to open in early 2022 according to sign on door, called OTR (On The Rocks LLC)."
Not a put lot of Places to eat in Land O'Lakes I found this to be delicious Locos sitting everywhere very popular place food is delicious good job Chef
"Found a new Chinese spot on the block and we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend thought the soy ribs were okay. It had good flavor but it was on the dry side. The salt & pepper shrimp was pretty good. Did not lack in flavor. The combo fried noodles was probably everyone's favorite. The fried pot stickers is a 8/10. Lastly, the bao was probably the most disappointing thing for me. It was so salty that I felt like it was dipped into the ocean. Hopefully they make the bao less salty in the future. Overall, everything was pretty good. Environment : This location is the old Korean restaurant. Everything inside still remains the same. Therefore, the parking spots are still tight and small. Service: there was a nice sweet man that greeted us and cashed us out. The restaurant itself didn't have many customers when we arrived so hopefully this business gets more customers so it can keep running. I would rate this place a 7/10 from the food we got."
This is a good place for breakfast! We go often. The pancakes are huge. The skillets are delicious. The French toast is yummy. The OJ is refreshing. They try to be as healthy as possible. There are several options for those watching their diet & vegetarians. They always have these nutritious juice blends. They also write certain seasonal specials on the chalk board. The service is great. People are very friendly & helpful. I definitely recommend.
"Good bagels with a multitude of different fixings. They are always busy, which is a good sign! I am not a coffee lover but my husband is and he has been very happy with his choices. I am looking forward to returning and trying the biscuits and gravy!"
"I first had this 4 years ago in cincy. When I found out they had a location in Indy, I had to go. I ordered the same exact meal I had 4 years ago plus a few extras. The chicken club, Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, cornbread, succotash, herb fries. It was CFP championship day so they were prepping for the long night. We got there at 4 right when they opened and they were already crowded. The sandwhich was good, It didn't wow me like before. The Mac and cheese are just spiral noodles with a wet cheese sauce, the sweet potatoes were cold and the marshmallows were charred but not warm (these were replaced and not charged when we requested a fresh order), fries were delicious and flavorful, the cornbread was probably my favorite side, the succotash was also cold. I'm not taking off many stars because I understand the rush and trying to be prepared. The 4 stars is cause the flavor was there, was just lacking in temperature. Would def go back to watch a sports game, it's the perfect set up!"
"I come here every trip to New Orleans sometimes I eat here twice. If it is lunch, it the Ferdi, if it is breakfast, it's an shrimp étouffée omelette. Trust me, don't be talked into substituting shrimp creole for shrimp étouffée; it's no contest."
"So glad they opened this second location so I don't have to hunt for and then pay for parking to visit the restaurant. Also don't have to contend with the traffic on Mandalay Avenue. Friendly staff. I ordered takeout of tuna and salmon nigiri and it was very FRESH, well packed, with high quality ginger and strong wasabi. Look forward to visiting again. I ordered my takeout by walking into the store, but I noticed today that there's a separate door or window around the corner, on the side street, that said ""PICKUP"" or ""TAKEOUT."" Will try that next time. Full bar."
"Spent a Saturday afternoon on the rooftop and had the best time, it's a Broadway bar so I wasn't surprised when some of the drinks had a soft poor but the overall live music and atmosphere and decorations made this one of my favorite spots. Although I didn't eat at this location and cannot speak on the I recommend the rooftop and drinks to anyone visiting Nashville!"
"I eat here at least twice a week. This particular location always runs out of essential ingredients in the evening, such as avocado, certain type of bread, arugula, certain cheese, certain chicken, even apple--you name it, they don't have it. Not sure if this is part of the supply chain issue or it's just not properly managed. Other than the ""sold out"" issue mentioned above, it's a typical Panera Bread."
Awesome cookies of all types and flavors. A bit crazy on a weekend night and a small place with no organization but...with the wait!
"Got two pizzas for takeout on NYE. The husband and I really liked the traditional hand-stretched crust. We got the rosemary potato and the wild mushroom pizzas, and they let me order the wild mushroom with red sauce (as opposed to the traditional white). I thought the rosemary potato was a litttttle too salty (the spinach or the olive tapenade) and had to alternate bites with the crust to even out the flavors, but the wild mushroom was excellent. Will definitely dine in to try some of their other pizzas and entrees at some point!"
"The ambience is great. .and so is the food!! My favorite was ceviche which was made at the table, and was delicious. Quantity is similar to other Mexican restaurants..overall we left with a happy experience. Thanks."
"We have ordered from here a couple of times and it never disappoints. Everything from the wraps, burgers and pizza is great. I highly recommend the grandma pizza and the avocado wrap!"
"Really nice restaurant! Fast service great staff, giving it a 4 star review just because I didn't like my dish lasy time, next time I'll try something else! Everyone else in my party LOVED their food! Definitely give it a try!"
We had our order delivered to our hotel which was so convenient after a day's travel. The lemon chicken was absolutely delicious The chicken with cashews was so good had a great kick to it. We had our order in about an hour hot and fresh.
"Had a couple of martinis here with my fiancé and was very happy with how delicious the drinks were. Didn't realize how expensive food was, would probably come here for a special occasion due to the price however I would definitely come back for drinks. We came on a Monday so it wasn't very busy, and the weather made it too cold to sit outside. Heard great things about this place so I'll come back during summer to enjoy the outdoor patio."
"Jeannine's is a nice breakfast and brunch spot across from the wharf with ocean views. I ordered a simple two egg breakfast with toast and fresh squeezed orange juice. I placed a to go order and enjoyed my breakfast in the sand! The staff were very welcoming and quickly took my order. While I waited, I noticed how cute and quaint this place is. I was quickly served and left to the beach to enjoy. I would say my breakfast was about 3.5 and the juice and service was a 5! My eggs and potatoes were meh and sourdough was good. I think next time I will try a pastry (that seems to be the thing to get at Jeannine's)."
"Came here to try a new joint for dinner and drinks. It reminds me of a friends basement bar. Drinks were poured well and there is an entire page of the giant menu dedicated to BURGERS. The Cajun burger, add bacon and Guac was delicious."
"Love almost everything there. Their Generals is not traditional Generals but its great. Hot and sour soup is great. Fantastic eggrolls. Their weakest dish is their fried rice...not very good. Dry and not much meat in it. Other than. That I recommend the Generals, mandarin chicken, Korean bulgogi, sweet and sour chicken, sweet and sour pork, shrimp and garlic sauce."
"Great place for seafood! We got the boil bucket for 2. Free hush puppies with meal. The crab was a tad overcooked, but they replaced it. Waitress was attentive and food was tasty!"
"Such a nice addition to the neighborhood, very cozy and delicious. The speak-easy downstairs is pretty neat too. I would have given Bocca 5 stars, but I came here with friends one time and checked the website to see if they were open, they were... but once we got there they were closed for a private party with the doors locked. Also, came for a birthday celebration and the owner/manager was slightly cold. My recommendations, the baked goat cheese and beet salad to start. For an entree, the della casa, but substitute the shrimp for ground sausage. Finally, finish it off with the bombolini."
Excellent choices of sushi and our server was actually friendly compared to the other AYCE sushi joints. We tried them all and would go back to this one.
Today is an updated S/O to Molly Mallory's on the continued and quality products they deliver to the customers! Today I wanted to bring friends from out of town to get a great breakfast! The portions are always sizable and the service was great! The drinks that accompanied our meal were just what we needed! We all took home a 'Pop Tart'! This filling was citrus flavored grapefruit...So Yummy! Keep Doing Your Thing Molly's & I'll Keep Coming Back For More!
"Some of the best chicken wings anywhere PERIOD. Hooters got nothing on these wings. KFC you must have missed the cooking lesson that the head chef here attended cause you could use the help. This would open Popeye's other eye in surprise. Nowhere in Buffalo can touch this place and I hit at least 15 places up there looking for great wings. Oh, BTW, They have great Pho Ga and other Vietnamese dishes. Only big negative is that they do not have a grilled chicken dish on the menu. So my go to Grilled Chicken Vermicelli is absent and no 5 starts for this place."
"Classic dishes with a historical NOLA feel. I loved the decor and music of Brennan's! I felt transported back in time. We ordered the ""A Chanteclaire Christmas"" and ""Advent En Audubon"" and they both tasted well balanced. I really enjoyed my turtle soup and my boyfriend enjoyed his potato rosti. The ham and eggs were a little dry in our croque madames. I also couldn't really taste the black truffle in the croque madame. My boyfriend thought the cheddar grits were very good. The banana foster was great! I loved the flambé at the table. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear the history of the banana foster that I heard other servers explaining to the tables around us. Despite the minor critiques I've written, I would recommend Brennan's to friends and family. I would like to return to try their dinner menu in the future!"
"Cool vibe, great drinks, inside and outside seating. Great menu This is a great place to go for a date night or drinks with friends. It can get loud on the weekends because it's such a fun place to be. I love how they offer indoor and outdoor seating but all is covered so if you have a typical Florida rain you're OK. The menu is creative the food is good and the drinks are amazing!"
Good chi gao but could use mint leaves and or cilantro. The place was very busy which is a good sign. And at 2 that's impressive!
"We tried this place for the first time for lunch. It was really good and the portions are large. We shared our entrees I had the gyro with roasted potatoes and my husband tried the calamari which came with rice, bread, green beans and potatoes. The location is on a side street from 36 you may not see it from 36 but worth looking for. Next time we're definitely trying the flaming cheese appetizer. Back here today for lunch. They have a nice variety of options from appetizers, sandwiches and entrees for lunch. There's even a lighter side option served with a salad and smaller portion for lunch or dinner."
"New to St. Louis, checking out everything recommended. Brussel sprouts were good, the fish sandwich was better than okay, and the burger was okay. The drinks and service were excellent."
"I might not have noticed this place, as it is on the lower level of the building. A Too Good to Go offer brought me in, and I'm so glad I know it is here. It's the only cafe I've seen that offers misugaru, a grain-based breakfast drink. Since I'd only ever had it from the instant packets that a friend shared with me, I had to give that a try. They've got breakfast sandwiches with bibimbap that I need to go back to try. And the dalgona coffee, too. They use local La Colombe and Caphê coffees and Philly muffins. Great local business!"
"Loved the area & ambience, super cute. We only got to try one item but will be back for sure. The Smoked Pastrami Reuben on Seeded Rye was delicious. It was a good portion & tasted really good. We split it. The mustard was a bit too much for me & burnt my nose. My husband loves meat and he said he wishes it had more meat it in. The side salad was very nice & refreshing, with great dressing."
"Great place to hang quietly with a friend. This establishment utilizes local farmers, bakers, etc. Everything I have ever tried here has been great. I found a sandwich that I was in love with, but they removed it from the menu! Great grilled cheese here!!! Handmade aprons and cool little gifts... Definitely check it out. The staff is super nice! Avocado BLT, Chicken Goat, Roast Beef Sandwich, and Charcuterie are some great choices."
"I've been on hunt for a great study/work spot to hang out in when I need a change of scenery and I got just that. The atmosphere is so inviting and cozy here. There is plenty of seating so you don't have to worry about popping in for work and not being able to find a seat. The noise level was also perfect. I was a little worried that because this is a bigger coffee shop and it's downtown, it may be loud but it really wasn't. I ordered a cafe con leche and a Cuban sandwich and everything tasted delicious, flavorful and fresh. They do make the cafe con leche with condensed milk instead of regular milk which resulted in a foamier coffee. However the Cuban sandwich was made to perfection. I can tell it was fresh because the cheese melts away with each bite and each component of the sandwich was crispy and hot just the way I love it! All in all, if you're looking for a chill study or workspace, I'd encourage you to stop by. I can't wait to come back!"
Stopped here for lunch since I have never been to one before. Our waitress was very nice and patient with us since we had to research the menu a little before ordering. I ordered the half salad half club sandwich meal. It was a much larger portion size than I expected and was very good. I had to take home half of the sandwich. Prices were fair and they do have a full bar if you are interested. I will be back next time I am in town.
"We wanted to try out the Thai place so we decided to have dinner at Veggie Thai Cafe. It is a small cafe run by the family. After browsing through the menu we decided to order Crispy Spring Rolls, Veggie Pad Thai and Veggie Red Curry. We got our order in 10 minutes. The food was freshly cooked and it was hot. The spring rolls were perfectly fried as well as we loved the pad Thai and vegetable red curry. It was different from the normal Thai restaurant as it was all cooked with veggies."
"We stopped at Famous Dave's after a morning of shopping and we enjoyed the meal! The lunch specials are great and comes with 1, 2, or 3 meats; a side; and a cornbread muffin (which was frankly the best cornbread I've ever had). I ordered the 2 meat combo ($11.50 at lunch) and requested the brisket and the bbq chicken. The brisket was flavorful and juicy, which was great. The chicken was OK. it was definetly juicy which is good, but I wish I would've realized I could've asked for the spicier sauce. The original BBQ sauce is just too sweet for my liking. Ultimately, I think we'll be back if we're ever wanting some bbq!"
"Very nice. 4,25 Unassuming nice little spot, friendly service and nice conversation w/ what might be the owner or manager. Sangria and beer. Lots of delivery-take-out happening. If anyone had to wait on their pick up, they were offered a water or drink while they wait. Super nice. We tried the lomo salteado, which did not disappoint- steak, soy, garlic onions tomato peppers still a bit crispy fry base and side of fluffy arroz. Hubs tried the chaufa chicken , Peruvian fried rice, ok but a little 5 spice flavor which we don't love. It's like cilantro, not everyone is a fan! Eager to try the rotisserie chicken and maybe a delightful delicious dessert!"
"Iron Hill's are really good. Their food is actually better than their beer and there isn't anything wrong with the beer. These are big and clean places. They are perfect restaurants for first dates, business meals and family time. Lots of choices of yummy comfort food and an original selection of beers. I wouldn't go out of my way just for the beer but I would for the overall experience."
"This is a family owned pizzeria. It's my favorite neighborhood spot for cheesesteaks or pasta dishes (Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo). The restaurant is clean, ample seating. There is a small outside seating area that is put up outside during the summer months, when the weather permits. COVID-19 protocols are practiced here. The owners are very friendly, helpful and inviting. I have not had a bad meal here. This is my go to spot when I have cheesesteak cravings. The cheesesteaks only come in one size. Hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, pasta dishes, salads are a few categories to choose from. You can dine in or order to go. You can even use food delivery services. Grub Hub or Doordash provide coverage for this establishment. Cash/Credit or debit are accepted here."
"Delicious chicken, yummy sauce, friendly staff, and crinkle fries! I usually don't like crinkle fries because they remind me of old soggy school cafeteria fries... & these fries came kind of soggy, but I was able to reheat my fries in the airfryer at home which made them 1000x better!!! The toast that came with the chicken finger combo was nice and buttery. The buns on the sandwich combo was soft and fresh. The chicken is so well-seasoned! I couldn't stop dipping the fries in the sauce! Sooo good! The drive thru line is usually busy, but for good reason!! So if you ever see it not busy, GO GET SOME! Even if you're not hungry. Bring it home and reheat it in the airfryer. If you don't have an airfryer, what year are you living in????? How are you surviving life without one?? Go get some chicken and an airfryer."
"We visited the restaurant on a Sunday for brunch and they were pretty busy so we had an hour wait. Which wasn't a big deal because we just walked on Central avenue and grabbed some coffee until we received the text that our table is ready. The staff was friendly and the food was great. The atmosphere is nice, indoor/outdoor vibe. I wish the menu wasn't so limited but my sandwich was yummy! I also tried my friend's vegan sandwich and that was delightful as well! I want to come back one day to try their ceviche :)"
"We ordered artichoke pizza, which was excellent. I a had a brisket sandwich with delicious fries. My fiancé had the toasted ravioli with excellent marinara. The service was par, but nothing to write home about, however the restaurant was busy during the lunch rush hour. This is a good restaurant and a safe bet for good food if in the Lafayette square area"
"We ordered takeout for the first time from here. Went to pick it up and the place was dark and thought it looked closed. Opened the door and it was bright and active. Full bar area and lots of people. Got the Tuesday special with pepperoni and a Greek salad. Both were very good and filling. Next time I want to go and stay, looked like a good crowd with a fun staff."
I visited your establishment with a group of 12. Crystal did a great job on providing great service. I enjoyed the Pork Ossobuco. The rest of the group enjoyed there meals as well. My only surprise through out the evening is when I asked for an espresso. How can an Italian Restaurant not have espresso? If had one suggestion that is what I would suggest.
"I made reservations a week in advance due to the weekend being New Years Eve weekend. Checking in was smooth, the host sat us early. It took a while for the waitress to take our order but it wasn't a huge issue since we weren't in a rush. The restaurant had a special NYE menu that day so we weren't able to try the other dishes which is shown in the other customer's images. That was disappointing since there wasn't a huge selection of dishes that night. So I felt a bit robbed. Anyway, I ordered a half dozen oysters, gator bites, and the Louisiana sampler (jambalaya, crawfish Étouffée, red beans and rice, and gumbo), and for dessert the Bananas foster bread pudding. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the fresh oysters. The service was okay. Our waitress came off a little rude, slightly impatient, but I didn't want to hold it against her because it was a busy night. I just hope she doesn't act like that towards customers everyday. I do plan on returning in the future hoping that I'll get to try a full menu, instead of a limited menu."
"This place has great pizza. My usual go tos' - margarita pizza and plain with olives. Was perfectly sauced and toasted, thin and crispy perfection the way I prefer it. I usually just get pizza here, but the wings were good too!"
"Great breakfast! The sausage, country potatoes and eggs over easy were all great tasting. The sausage was fresh tasting with great flavor. The potatoes were seasoned with spices I couldn't name, but I know good food. My orange was a nice compliment instead of coffee. However, my partner had coffee. There was no bread product that came with the meal, but since the restaurant also has a bakery there were lots of yummy choices. I ordered a chocolate eclair as a special breakfast dessert. The cream was thick and delicious on the eclair. It was way too much to eat, so I had some left over for later. The negative comments I have is that food was ordered at register and NO cash payments. One waiter/bus person for entire restaurant, so coffee refills were slow and waiter/bus person had to be flagged down for refills. Lastly, I liked the options of where to dine. Indoor or outdoors. We chose the outdoor table under an umbrella. It was perfect!"
"Ate at the bar. Excellent margaritas. Not the cheap mix that gives me a headache, but fresh squeezed lime. The shrimp basket and grouper fish taco (a little cold) were delicious. Loses a star because this place is an absolute zoo. I feel like I was battling for a bar seat to avoid an hour wait. A place you should go at least once, but too crazy busy and took forever to get food, not to mention the level of aggression you must use to get the bar tenders attention."
"I visited blind tiger for the first time today after being a loyal Starbucks addict and i must admit, blind tiger has Starbucks beat by a long shot. I ordered a 16oz vanilla butterbean hot latte with almond mild and it was delicious. Not super sweet and a perfect brew. They also sell teas, pastries, hot breakfast, and bags of tea to brew at home. The only reason i didn't give a full 5 stars is because they are very expensive. The coffee was $8.06 and that would've afford me a venti coffee at Starbucks at least."
"I had a pizza craving and stopped here for a bite to eat. The pizza was fantastic and did not disappoint. The Toscano Pizza hit the spot with spinach, tomato and ricotta. I noticed they offer take out but no delivery which is another option. There are pasta choices too as the name implies. I have been here before and ordered a pasta meal. Either option is good eats. The only downside to this restaurant is the on-site parking. It wasn't an issue for me but could be a problem if you visit during a busy time. I did notice alternate parking on the other side of the street if on-site parking is not available."
"I ordered pizza's and jalapeño poppers for my family who were driving in from Ohio. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, a Sicilian Mama's Supreme and two orders of jalapeño poppers. The pepperoni pizza was a thin crust and any of there Sicilian pizza's are a thick crust. My family loved the pizza's and poppers. The sauce was a little to sweet for me, but tasted good overall."
"One of the best Tres Leches cakes I have ever had ( and I really like Tres Leches) The cake was spongy and had the perfect texture for absorbing the milk. Even leftover, it was not soggy, and still delicious. I highly recommend this bakery for this cake and their fresh Mexican pastries."
"Pros: Cocktail shrimp appetizer was fresh and tasty, side of peewee potatoes were delicious, but the salad was an experiment gone awry. They just didn't pull off whatever they were attempting with the salad."
"We had some initial confusion with the hostesses about getting a table, as we did not have a reservation, but were seated at a nice table in the bar which was wonderful. Friendly service, good food...enjoyed the salads and sushi a lot. Just a note here that their Covid policy is outdated. Idaho is no longer in a state of emergency and totally open. Some employees choose to wear masks."
"My father-in-law wanted to share this special place with us. He lived in the area for years, and this was his ""go to"". We had such a fun time! The trout was incredible, but I loved my husband's red fish even more...literally one of the best bites of fish I have ever had! We all had appetizers that were incredible, and the drinks were pretty great! I love that our experience lasted for hours...it was just a fun way to spend the evening! I was kind of excited because I had been told that it was an establishment were the men had to wear jackets, and my father-in-law pointed out the extra jackets inside (to go to those who didn't wear one upon entering?). They didn't seem to make anyone do that, which isn't a big deal as a whole, but for him, the ""specialness"" of it had seemed to dissipate over the years, and he felt like the standards weren't quite the same as they were back in the early 2000's."
"It's not my favorite, but it does good in a pinch. I like the carne asada burrito, but make sure to use the sauces! If you're not willing to wait in a potentially long line, don't go!"
I order from Ginza at least once a week. My husband prefers their sushi and gyoza over a pricier spot a few blocks north. The seaweed salad is always fresh and tasty. The ribs are delicious. The owners/staff are always kind. The bento boxes are a great deal. I'm so happy to have Ginza nearby!
Food and drinks were all excellent extremely delicious! I'm giving 4 Stars for prices my husband myself and our toddler ate there for lunch yesterday $90 that's more than any steakhouse but it was really good!!
"The ambiance at Stateside was unmatched. The DJ was popping off and the bar was also so fun, it was really fun as a big group of girls. Here is a recap of of food: Apple Cider Mimosa and Frosée- both delicious and strong, I think the Frosée was better. Baked Crab dip and Monkey bread to share- Crab dip hit the spot, we loved the Monkey Bread but wished it was bigger/more gooey. I had the Stateside Omelette which was good but nothing special. The food was pretty good but we mostly loved the drinks/ambiance. Super fun for a big group."
Third time at Alfredos Cafe and its been beyond wonderful every singe time. From Mexican breakfast to chicken sandwiches to smoothies this place is a for sure win! Thank you Alfredos ! See you guys again soon..
"First visit to this location, Sister had purchased gift certificate for Mom and wife and I. Ambience was nice and they seemed to be clean, compliant in all the rules and regulations. I like the open kitchen concept, entertaining if you are close enough to watch. Location was reasonably full, good to see, for a 6:15 reservation. Reservation was on time and set up ahead for us and appreciated. Initial service and drinks were prompt. Food was delivered in a timely fashion and delicious. Everybody enjoyed their selections. There were only a couple of very minor missteps by the server but corrected quickly. Overall, a pleasant experience. Dropped one star as I felt, for the price point, the portions could be a bit larger."
"Used to be the B-Line which makes me nervous about restaurant turnover in same location. However, Great little burger joint. Seating is tight but the food is tasty. Also good selection of beers. We had the 420 Burger wasn't too spicy as the cream cheese counters it nicely. My group also had the Thunder Bacon BAMF which the 15yr old inhaled so I'm really sure he tasted it. Best Compliment I can give is that I'd go back."
"TL;DR - Good, but somewhat forgettable. Skip the pad thai, definitely order a seasonal cocktail, and be prepared to wait. Pros: The service was wonderful and the drinks blew us away. I got a Thai Iced Tea that was wonderful and my partner ordered an Old Fashioned. The staff was incredibly friendly and sociable. Also, they offer a digitized wait list so that you can see where your party is at on the wait list and how long you've been waiting. Cons: The food didn't live up to the hype. It was good food, don't get me wrong, but my expectations were pretty high after hearing raving reviews from others. Also, we were quoted a 25-30 minute wait and we ended up waiting almost an hour. It's a pretty small place and it doesn't take reservations. While they do offer a digital, real-time wait list that you can view on your phone to see your place in line, the digital wait list doesn't provide a time estimate for the wait. (Which I do recognize is more of an art form rooted in experience rather than a science.)"
"Me and my wife just loved going here on Friday and Saturday nights for live bands and lots and lots of dancing with great people. My memories of this bar, just make me cry with how much fun me and my wife had going here. She had been dead 9 years now. But my memories of going to Tuners are so strong in my mind. I stop in every once in awhile. I live 30 miles away now. . Which was no problem when the wife was ok, but things change. I really miss the place so very much."
Great late night pizza spot in the french quarter. Cant beat it. Good location near convenience stores and xheaoer than most other tourist spots.
What a great hidden gem! Stopped by for lunch and drinks and it did not disappoint. I look forward to coming back here to try more of the items on the menu and soaking up the atmosphere. Get the coconut shrimp!
"Barcelona Pizza has been my go-to spot every Sunday. I'm from Philly so I need me a good cheese steak from here and there and this is the place to go! Their Pizza is ""so so"" I have had good pies from them and I have had pies that taste like a school lunch but over all I like the establishment and will continue to try different things."
came here for sushi and the menu is quite small but very good!!! one of the best sushi places i've been too!!! and they have i think 2 billiards tables!! very nice inside. they also have nice outdoor seating. good service. 10/10
The Pour House is our weekend staple. No matter when we go we can always find a seat which is surprising considering how awesome this place is. The food is alway delicious and it's a perfect place for a Sunday Fun Day.
Literally the BEST sushi restaurant in Tampa. Everything is fresh and so good. The employees are super friendly and helpful. Their Krab Rangoons are made in house and are the BEST I've ever had. They also sell Picnic Boxes for a perfect date night idea. Saturday night music nights are a plus also.
"Wine society is the most adorable little find ! The decor is so beautiful and it's such a cozy spot ! The service is great , they always have specials and their charcuterie boards are amazing ! Awesome place for dates or just a good time with your closest girls !"
"My family and I have been dining here for 15+ years. We have lived in the area for 25+ years. This is hands down the best restaurant in the area within 20 miles. The service is second to none, bartenders are excellent, and the entire staff is friendly and welcoming. You will feel at home with a dining experience here. The appetizers are eclectic, sure to entice anyone's pallet. The entrees offered include a a handful of pastas, ranging from seafood to excellent spaghetti w/ meatballs. The steak options will suffice for anyone choosing a beef option, topped with garlic and an abundance of seasoning. The house salad is a must. The seasoning and amount of cheese is perfect. Very limited outside dining, but the atmosphere of inside dining is worth going indoors. Furthermore, they have a ton of dessert options to make any celebration worth dining here. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the South County, MO area."
"great place to hang out and grab a latte and read a book. the ambiance is very homie - and they have pages from old books cascading from the ceiling. there isn't a whole lot in terms of seating, but it is an intimate coffee shop with books that you can purchase. i love the wooden center bar in the middle of the store, it definitely adds to the environment. i got one of their seasonal latte's, and it was perfect. Milky, frothy, and not too sweet. I'll definitely come back, and it feels like the perfect place to go on a snow day"
"Fun place with nice bar selection of all kinds of local draft beers. This place brought me back to my childhood of playing super Nintendo in my room as a teenager. Pizza could be better, just ok."
"My new FAVORITE in Dunedin/Tampa Bay. Had Yucatan style Torta Pibil which was outstanding, served with a green salsa similar to argentine chimichurri. Served with excellent warm fresh chips and red salsa with a nice kick. Can't wait to work thru more of a very interesting menu! The offerings far exceed the standard fare! Decor is very comfy with saltillo tile floor, walls adorned with mexican plates and artwork and good lighting. Take the time to get here!!"
"When RJ asked what I wanted for my birthday, I said Rice. It is always consistently delicious and the staff is always friendly and attentive. Melly was our server and she was terrific. We both started with a Mai Tai and.a spicy Kani salad. This is one of our favorite versions, fresh and spicy. We shared pan fried pork gyoza which were crisp and juicy. RJ ordered the Mikasa roll and I ordered the Mango Paradise Roll which is my favorite sushi roll of all the places we have had sushi. The mikasa used to be the hairy Mexican which is shrimp tempura, Kani, and spicy Mayo and eel sauce. The Mango paradise is lobster tempura with mango, avocado in soy paper with peanuts and spicy mango sauce. Both rolls were phenomenal and there were no leftovers!"
"Great food, great drinks, great server! First time in Clearwater, we looked up Cooters and thought it was our kind of joint. It was better than expected. We split the Daytona Tequila wings, shrimp dip, crab stuffed shrooms and blackened gator tail. We couldn't finish it all. The rum runner, banana split and pirate punch were awesome! We will definitely be returning!"
Great help when we came off a 12 hour drive. I mentioned we were at a nearby hotel. Food was hot and ready in 15 minutes. The female packed everything we needed knowing we had nothing. Hot and sour soup was just like I like it. Excellent fried rice.
"Definitely my favorite take out during Covid,hands down. Everything was great from the salad to dessert. Not all restaurants were good at this in the covid pandemic. They did an outstanding job!Really well done. Nothing cold or greasy. I think the price equals the quality of food and service. Highly recommend The Capital Grille. They will not disappoint."
"I have been wanting to go to this restaurant and it did not disappoint. The service and the food were phenomenal. We started with cocktails and calamari and I must say the cranberry bourbon cocktail is . Our entrees (pictured below) included the snapper, romano crusted chicken and the famous tortelloni Michelangelo. All full of spice and delicious. It was also nice to be able to sit and enjoy dinner for a couple of hours with friends without being rushed. It's really enjoyable evening."
"In a day and age when good service is hard to find, exceptional service is a rare treat. We had the very good fortune to be waited on by Markqus this evening and received just that - exceptional service. He's the guy you want to enhance your dining experience. Oh yeah, and the food was great. Delicious Grouper Sandwich and someone in our group just raved about her burger! This was our first time here and we will be back!"
I enjoyed the menu and the laid-back atmosphere. I will definitely return. Loved the crab and the bison tacos! I went 2 days in a row. Lobster Nibblets were great as well.
"Been coming to this establishment for awhile now, usually I sit at a table, but this particular night I decided to sit at the bar instead. Chelsea is the best bartender there is. She made us laugh, she made our drinks right in front of us, and they were so delicious. Another fun night for the books."
"Great Indian food spot, and a helpful staff as well. Discovered some new indian food faves thanks to this place! Their lamb khorma (spelling) will make anyone a Indian food fan, guaranteed. Vindaloo and mansala, many excellent dishes. Been coming for years and is always good!"
"So impressed with this restaurant! I haven't been able to find great sushi in North Pinellas since Jo-To's in Countryside closed several years ago. We've been here several times for lunch and everything has been great--very fresh, HUGE portions and ridiculously fair prices! They have a great assortment of Bento boxes as well as regular and fancy rolls and appetizers. I've had all the tuna and avocado rolls as well as some of the Tempura ones; all delicious. The restaurant is EXCEPTIONALLY clean, including the bathrooms, and the inside seating is pleasant and serene. Really nice spot for a quiet, cozy lunch. We feel very fortunate to have Sakura within walking distance and we can see they've already built up a nice customer base. Publix sushi NO MORE!"
"This is the only local ShopRite I will go to. It's always clean, staff is usually on the floor restocking throughout the store and there are never long lines when I'm there. It's a nice store and the parking lot is not gigantic so parking is always a breeze too!"
"The environment was great. Absolutely loved the self serve beer it was a great way to keep our party entertained and the white pizza, AMAZING"
"I ordered takeout from Juan's Flying Burrito for the first time and really enjoyed it! I am gluten free, but they are able to make any of the burritos as a bowl. I ordered the Al pastor and it was delicious! I cant wait to come back!"
Went there for lunch today. Fabulous meal. Had the house salad with raspberry vinaigrette. Fabulous. Entree was flaky fish with lemon wine sauce. Fabulous. Like to know what type of fish they used. Please respond. Creme brûlée was fabulous. Will return monthly. Thank you guys & gals.
I can here for a tournament and I ate here everyday it was so good! I recommend for anybody considering coming to Tucson Arizona.
"Very nice, helpful employees. They were only taking mobile orders but the app is not user friendly and needs a search button. They gave the kids cookies. They were very patient.."
Owners are so nice and food is to die for!!!!! Best Thai ever!!!! Food made with love from owners family recipes!!!
One of my favorite Italian spots in Indy. Great place for a date or dinner with the girls. Highly recommend the sausage and fig flatbread. The sausage pasta is one of my go to's. Servers are well versed in wine recs.
"First time here! Found this place via Yelp and Google. We ordered the Half Rack ribs (mango habanero) combo with fries and a drink, and also Bone of 9 wings (garlic parmesan). The wings came out crispy and perfectly seasoned with garlic parmesan and large wings compared to some other wings joints. The side of ranch was not needed but definitely nice for additional dipping! The half rack ribs were cut into smaller pieces for easy chewing and the mango habanero flavor is delicious. The fries taste fresh and are crunchy, but lacks a bit of flavor. I hope they add a garlic parmesan fries to their menu! I will definitely be back to try the different wings flavors!"
Everyone please come here and support this business!!! The chicken is amazing!!! SOOOO CRISPY! Better than Bonchon!! The service is amazing and so quick. We came on a Sunday afternoon and dined in. The chicken was spicy but we wanted the spicy flavors. One of the best Korean fried chicken wings I've had! They also have grilled wings too. We also got the fried chicken sandwich and that was amazing too!!! I'm so glad this opened up in the neighborhood and wish I came here sooner!! My mouth is watering writing this thinking about how good their food was! Can't wait to come back!!
"This tiny place just off Tyrone Blvd is hidden at the end a small strip mall. Had to do a U-Turn because I missed it on the first pass but well worth the effort. The all you can eat sushi dinner menu at ($27 per person. All-You-Can-Eat lunch also available at a lower price) is quite a deal. I have paid $8 for a single sushi roll at other establishments. So there is no doubt you will get your moneys' worth here. Our waitress Elena brought our selections to the table so quickly I was wondering where she kept her super-heroine cape! All-you-can-eat restaurants rely on giving you a good long wait time before delivering selections to allow you to become full. NOT HERE AT UMAMI!!! My son and I would be just finishing a plate when Elena would bring another one. At no time were we waiting for selections to be delivered. Large portions of Wasabi and Ginger were delivered upon request, and Elena was quick to top off our water as well. Dirty dishes were whisked away to make room for full dishes and Elena helped explain our menu selections. I mentioned that they could skip the rice to make room for more fish, and from that point forward all the entrees that were not rolls came with no rice. I don't often give 5 stars. This is a restaurant that prides itself on delivering an outstanding dining experience."
"I try to keep my reviews leaning positive and give recognition where it's due. Stopped into Cloud 9 on Sunday night to get out of the house and grab a drink with my gf. We sat on the south side, with the smaller bar. There are some tvs to watch the game, but it's a cozy spot and not loud. From the start, our server Jessica was very friendly and attentive, even though it looked like she was moving around a bit to take care of stuff in the back and prep silverware. The only tricky part was figuring out what we wanted, but she talked to us about their beer and food options and brought out samples. Just a pleasant experience and you can tell everyone (customers and staff) enjoyed it there. I got the standard burger and it was great. Their beer selection is solid, I had the amber and double IPA and my gf loves the honey basil. Will come back for beer/sports/food."
"Went here while out exploring the area and had the Kung Fu beef noodle soup, medium spicy. Definitely could've been a little spicier but otherwise it was excellent. The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant is clean."
"I want everyone in the Philadelphia metropolitan area to descend on this place like suburban moms going to the strip mall on Black Friday morning. I want whoever is reading this to drop your phone right now, leave your house in whatever you're wearing, and hit the road. Because I want this place to become so popular that it never closes down. If you've never had a mochi ring donut, it's deep fried like a regular yeast donut, but made with tapioca/rice flour, which gives them a more springy consistency and slightly different flavor. (That description doesn't feel quite right... you just have to try them to understand). The icings are also better than average donut shops because they have things like yuzu, black sesame, and taro. They also have more traditional icings like strawberry or Nutella, but super-flavorful. To add icing to all of the icing you'll already have, they serve really great bubble tea. And corn dogs that are kind of hard to describe but you should eat them. And that's a full, balanced meal, folks."
My go to neighborhood Chinese restaurant. They always get my order right. Food is made very quickly and fresh. Reasonable prices. The kung poa chicken is soo tasty. The general Taos has a light sweetness and isn't coated in too much breading. The Mongolian beef was very tender.
"Loved the variety in fisherman's feast. Mini lobster rolls were amazing. Great food! Priced well. Would definitely recommend. I know some people are saying it's a tad pricey. Which is probably so. However, I've heard the rent in the ""currents of windermere"" is absolutely insane so I can't fault them for being a tad high on the price what so ever."
"This place is some of the BEST BBQ I've ever had! I've had it all chicken, ribs, beef brisket, smoked sausage it's all fantastic!!! For your side make sure you get the baked beans - you can thank me later :). The also have yummy fried catfish, chicken strips and wings! Just eat here - you won't regret it!!!"
"Awesome little pizza spot, personal pies made to order with tons of options. Went in for the lunch special, pizza and a drink for $9. Everything we ate was delicious and the staff was awesome. Def will be back!"
Wonderful atmosphere even though I was waiting to pick up it was still very welcoming. The pizza came out hot and it smelled/tasted delicious! Will go back again!
"I'm not sure why people are saying the pizza isn't great - it's some of the best Philly pizza for sure, and they have so much variety. I've also ordered the cauliflower crust and it is WOW. Amazing, you cannot tell a difference aside from the pizza itself being a little smaller (it's only $15/pie, though). Crisp, doesn't taste weird, and delicious. When I went in for dining, We got the octopus which was cooked well, the Caesar salad which was very good, and a sashimi dish that was fresh and delicious. We also got the tavern style pizza with dairy free cheese and it was shockingly amazing. I'm not sure what brand of dairy free cheese they use, buts it's the best DF pie in the city for sure, and the thin crust is awesome. Their cocktails were a little bizarre, but I love the creativity. Will definitely be back."
"Try the cochon de lait po boy and the boudin balls! They're both excellent! We loved the onion rings and the buffalo wings have a unique and flavorful sauce that my husband has been back for a few times since he's been working in Nola. Great staff! - Especially Evan who helped us out with nearby brunch recommendations too! This felt like a locals-only hangout right around the corner from Bourbon Street. It's not ""fine dining,"" but for bar food and great company, it's stellar!"
I would give this restaurant a 10!!! My sister and I went to coyote crossing for lunch! All I have to say is WOW!!! There food is out of this world!!!! Everything was delish and the fresh squeezed lemonade was sooo good!!!
The food is outstanding !!! Only thing I regret is not visiting sooner !!! Flavor in each dish is amazing !
"We were warmly greeted and seated promptly, orders placed, and our food and drinks arrived quickly. The plates were gorgeous and the sauces are spectacular. Our daughter ordered the sautéed (yawn) tofu salad and to my astonishment it tasted fabulous, spicy and perfectly marinated and pan- browned. The drinks were good, too, my margarita was served with a dollop of sciracha, yum."
"A little off the beaten path down in queen village, but what a gem. Awesome indoor decor with a great bar that looks splendid to sit at on a cold night. Cocktails, apps, and entrees were all great."
"We were looking for somewhere to eat on New Year's Eve and decided to try Koi because they didn't seem crowded. We were immediately greeted when we entered and sat at a table right away. There aren't many tables inside but you can dine-in. Our waitress was very nice and got our drinks quickly. We ordered two orders of spring rolls, one chicken and shrimp hibachi and one chicken and steak hibachi. The spring rolls were hot, the outside was crisp and they had veggies on the inside. The dipping sauce was a sweet sauce and very tasty. The salad dressing was wonderful and the salad was very cold. I loved the fried rice - the texture was like a cloud! All of the hibachi meat was delicious and I liked that it came with a good amount of vegetables. We definitely had leftovers to take home. The bill was $44 which was great for a good hibachi meal. I expected a mall-food court type meal but this was far better than I expected! Also, since it was only us dining in - it was like private dining! It seems like they do a big carry-out business. I'm looking forward to eating here again and even trying their sushi!"
First time trying this place and yum!! We've been looking for a good local pizza spot in South Tampa for a few years and can't believe we didn't try this place sooner. We ordered our pizza and received it 25 minutes later piping hot. 10/10 delicious pizza.
"My favorites at Mr Wok: Egg Drop Soup, Hunan Beef and Pepper Steak. I try to get a new dish every time we order since their menu is pretty big and really enjoy it all. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of? Mongolian Beef. It's very different from any other I had, most notably - it's missing green onions. Still tasty though! The absolute best thing about Mr Wok is how efficient they are with phone orders. They are friendly and super patient; no rushing you off the phone! If you order something and it's not available, they will even suggest similar dishes. Takes the anxiety out of ordering lmao. We have decent appetites and 2 small dishes plus a soup is good enough for dinner plus lunch the next day for both of us. Great deal!"
"Best Service, Best Food, Best Experience. 5 Stars!! You can tell from the moment you walk into the establishment you will be well taken care of."
Great dim sum place not located in Philly Chinatown. The food was good and the portion size was huge! Definitely come here with friends and family. The beef stuffed scallion pancake is a must get.
The best burgers and salads ( my fave is the Thai peanut with chicken) and the staff is always great!
"We've eaten here three times in the last two months. The Pupusa, Gordita and Tamales are delicious. The Parillada platter is almost big enough for two people. The meat is flavorful , even the Mac and cheese that comes with it is yummy, portions are generous. The sauces are amazing -very different from any pher Latin style sauces."
"Enjoyable new Colombian restaurant serving arepas, empanadas, Colombian fruit juices and other items. The restaurant is a little stark/ fast food ""order at the counter"", but the staff is friendly and the food is yummy. Recommend!"
"I've never had Szechuan cooking before so this was my first jump into it. I ordered the chongqing diced chicken, medium spicy. It really does numb your mouth lol this is fantastic. Very very good, I understand why this place is so popular with the locals."
"Compliments to the chef. The food was delicious, and the place is beautiful. I had an out of body experience there and felt my soul leave my body and I watched myself eat a delicious steak. It was really scary but also fun. I really enjoyed this place even though I did have a little spook. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Everything was just delicious!! Adored the slow cooked lamb stew and the dumplings, yummmmm!!! We slated the entire meal so fast, I forgot to take pictures, haha. Excellent Baklava and Turkish Coffee was also perfection."
"Cannot give this place enough stars! This is by far our favorite place to buy fresh fish in the area. Not only is the fish FRESH and amazing quality, the prices are very competitive. A couple pro moves: try the food stand in the front for a grouper sandwich and try the Blue Lagoon adult juice pouch for something fun ;) we continue to be loyal customers to this great establishment!"
I grew up in Illinois and Eckert's has always been a family tradition or school field trip and it was always so much fun every time would feel like I have never been e before. The food is always so fresh and I love the peach picking tour riding the land of all the fresh vegetables and fruits they grow every year round for us. I am thankful for this Illinois Gem. They also have a really nice grocery store and restaurant connected you can do all in one. One stop shop seriously. I also love they carry local wines as well and they also let you have taste testing to try before you buy. My favorite is the Illinois Wine Cellar brand it's really delish and flavorful. If you are ever in the Belleville-Milstadt area stop by for some fresh fruit or veggies at the market. The service is always amazing as well. Enjoy until we meet again
"Yes it's a supermarket, but their selections are appreciated. The aisles feel larger. Aisles look fully stocked. Produce section looks organized and neat. Florist area has interesting balloons and flower items. I like the vast alcohol section and that there were a lot of sales. **Love the deli section! Neat, clean, beautifully displayed food items and breads. We ordered a custom sub sandwich and the friendly lady came up to us quickly with ""what kind of a sandwich can I make you today?"" Even if I didn't come for the sandwich, I certainly would order one just from that sweet greeting. Oh, that sandwich was heavy and sturdy. Price can't be beat!"
Much better service today from one of the servers that has been with Biscuits for years. They were fairly busy. Only recognized one of the guys cooking. Great Waffle. scrambled eggs and crispy bacon. And they had Jamaica. They were doing a lot of carry out too.
"Very helpful, friendly staff. They genuinely seem to want to make you happy with your order. Very busy but the line moves quickly. Delicious food. Great location if you are staying at one of the hotels close up the airport."
"Visiting from Redding Ca, there were so many sushi restaurants to choose from and by far the best sushi I have ever had. If you can bring the heat order the fireman roll or a more mild Dragon roll whatever you choose the servers are all nice and courteous and we'll make sure you have a great experience. 5 stars isn't deserving enough 10/10 would do it again."
Great breakfast sandwich! Ordered online and came within 15 minutes ! This here was bacon egg and cheese on a Kaiser.
"Talk about a good burger place! My husband and I LOVED our burgers and the Incline Fries were the icing on the cake. My husband also enjoyed the beer on tap, while I indulged in the complementary citrus water. The customer service was phenomenal, fast turnaround time once ordered, quality food, and the pricing was comparable. We will definitely make our way back to that part of town again, specifically for this place."
"One of my favorites places in the city. Food, drinks, and ambiance are all really good. I love the vegan cheesesteak burrito and have been ordering it for years!"
We my husband and I went on a Saturday evening to celebrate our Anniversary and my Bday. It was our first time there. The food was amazing! Our server was Mika who did a fantastic job who went above and beyond! We will be going back for sure.
"Without a doubt the best po boy's in New Orleans. Extremely nice staff, the manager is extremely kind and helpful. Great servings for the price. I recommend the fried shrimp po boy."
"The food is amazing! WOW just like Italy (the real deal)! Wait staff (Ruth and Shane) were excellent, very friendly and really cared about the table. It was a very busy night and everyone handled it great! We had the best night! If you love the food in Italy this is the place. The chef is from Naples, Italy. The owners seem to really care about each table. The gnocchi is amazing!"
"Fresh, delicious food! A lot of it sourced locally. Can't go wrong here! We ate there while my kids were in town. My eldest is a vegan. She did not go hungry. I am not a vegan, and neither did I! If you are vegetarian/vegan (yes, I understand the difference), gluten free (like I have to be), or a meat lover, everyone is invited to the table."
"Always a great experience, food came real fast. Loved the garlic wings, Best lemonade of the area. Pizza so delish!!"
Pad Thai is fantastic and fresh! We have been coming here for years and every dish we have ordered has been tasty. Our favorite is the drunken noodles with chicken. They recently expanded the dining area which turned out nice and isn't so tight. You can't go wrong ordering from this establishment.
"Food, libations, service, ambiance, and vibe are 5-star. The Wylder is reason alone to stop in Bosie. Newbie? Ask your server for guidance. Not that you can go wrong. I like to share one of their amazing salads and follow it with a pizza, which is irresistible here."
Ordered curb side pick up. Came out exactly when it was supposed to. Burritos are a really good size and love they have vegetarian option. Guacamole was so fresh and delicious. Will definitely be back
Always a fun time or great for a date night. Need to give it the praise it deserves. So many negative people out there!
Great food and great prices. I got the taco salad off the lunch menu for $10.00. So good!! Chips and salsa were complimentary! Great eating in the east.
"Some of my girlfriends and I decided on this restaurant last minute, best decision ever!! The staff was so welcoming and even on a busy Friday night they were able to squeeze us in. Not only was the service fantastic, but the food was amazing! 10/10, and highly recommended for people who aren't from the area and are wanting to try something different."
"It's easy to become skeptical after reading reviews, but all of it went right out the window the second I walked in! Nirvana Indian Cuisine is definitely the place to go to when craving Indian cuisine. Our server was Nilesh, and he was excellent! I had the tandoori chicken while my beautiful girlfriend had the chicken tikka masala. The tandoori chicken came out STEAMING. My jaw was wide open; I was so excited to try it! It was DELICIOUS! The chicken tikka masala was the best she's ever had! I also had a mango daquiri while she had a mango lassi. DELICIOUS AND REFRESHING! I also recommended getting the lasuni naan: thin, crispy, flavorful! WILL BE COMING BACK!"
"As long as you are patient enough for the wait...Mi Nidito is worth it!! The patty beef tacos are the best in town. Authentic and delicious Mexico food, that will not disappoint you. The wait can really suck, so be prepared. An early dinner or late lunch on the weekend might be your best bet. The frozen margaritas are delicious as well. You just can't go wrong with this Tucson original!"
"The five stars is mostly for the coffee. I got a cafe au lair, which is simple but depends on having good beans prepared well, and theirs was fantastic. They get their beans from Counterculture, which is one of the better coffee roasters around, and that shows, but I've also had coffee that wasn't as good from other places using the same beans. The service was pleasant and reasonably quick. It's also a pretty nice place to sit, with a number of tables in a space that has a sleek, modern design: light (maple?) wood, clean lines, semi-minimalist, with current local artists works on the walls. Way back in the day, when I was a brooding high school student, I was a regular at the Gryphon Cafe in Wayne, where I sipped coffee while writing character sketches in my Shinola notebook making fun of pretentious customers there X). I don't know if I've gone soft/too bougie, or the coffee's improved, or my palate has grown to better appreciate good coffee (I suspect a mix of all of those), but all I could think of visiting the new WC Gryphon location was how good the coffee is. P.S. My girlfriend got a chai latte and loved that, too."
"Beautiful place, went there with my boyfriend for his 21st birthday. Staff was nice and helpful, the food was so good!!! Will say, the void drink is an interesting one."
"This spot was on my list as soon as I booked my flight to New Orleans. Finally made it here with my boyfriend on our last day. We were greeted promptly and greeted by our server Jonathan. Jonathan was great and very friendly. We started with coffee. It was delish and fresh. For my meal I had the biscuits and gravy. It came with eggs, bacon, and a fried green tomato. Everything on this plate was absolutely delicious in flavor. The sausage gravy was one of the best I've ever had. Biscuit was airy and delish. This meal was made with love. My boyfriend had Bananas Foster Pain Perdu. Delicious as well. It was nice to see it was made with a baguette vs other bread. He enjoyed it a lot. I had a bite and enjoyed it as well. We also got a side of chorizo and a side of pork sausage. The chorizo as also the best we've had. A super delicious, filling and fresh breakfast!"
This was my first time eating here and I live close. This place is amazing. Everything is so fresh. Nothing was greasy and unhealthy. I will definitely be back for the great breakfasts!
"Everything from start to finish was a dream! Great wine selection, amazing service, & food was 10/10. The selfie situation in the bathroom was by far the best part tho"
"You know the BBQ is good when it tastes great without sauce! We went and a family and had chicks, pork, brisket and ribs and ALL were delicious!"
"This is a gem of a restaurant on a corner of what seems like a residential neighborhood. I came in a group of 6 around noon on a Saturday - it was quite busy but there were plenty of free tables. There are separate lines to order drinks and food (although you can order food in the drink line!) and they call your name over the speakerphone once it's ready. The atmosphere was great, food was so delicious, portions were HUGE for the price. The half and half sandwich only comes in the large size, so that means leftovers to enjoy later! There is plenty of free parking in their private lot, as well as along the street."
Getting ready to head back over in a bit. One of our favorite pizza spots in town and wanted give them a shout out. Love the Meridian Kessler and BLT pizzas. All the salads are great!
"I came here for brunch with some of my friends. It's a small little shop but the seating area is cute (feels like greenhouse vibes)! The servers here were soo friendly and the food came really quick. I got the Avocado Toast. This is one of the best ones I've had. The addition of the crumbled bacon was not only delicious, but added a wonderful crisp twist to the usual avocado toast. The sweet potato fries were also not too greasy, which I liked. Overall, such a a pleasant experience here :)"
Excellent restaurant! Highly recommend! We arrived with a party of six and found a table quickly. Ever aspect of our visit was terrific! Great friendly staff! Loaded waffle fries were the bomb! My burger was perfect! And I loved the Brussel sprouts with pecans. So good! Do your self a favor and come here with a appetite
Stopped here on our visit to at Louis. The food was good. The lady of soul cocktail... yummy. Service was great and fast.
"I was so excited to finally try HC Tavern. It was the last of the St. Elmo restaurants I needed to get to, and I was happy to see some favorites (like my cocktail!) and to try some new-to-me things. My sister and I decided on a Saturday lunch and headed to meet in the bar. First of all, the cozy booths at the bar are the perfect mix of comfy and upscale. The bartender was taking care of us that day and despite doing both jobs she was super attentive our entire visit. That cocktail I mentioned- Herb Your Enthusiasm-is one that I fell in love with at 1933, and she made it perfectly! We decided to splurge and try the Lobster-cargot as an appetizer and OMG. Delicious chunks of lobster swimming in garlic and butter, how can this go wrong? Of course it can't! Since it was lunch, I opted for the shrimp and lobster chopped salad, it came out pretty and tasted even better than it looked! My sister chose the scallops and she said they were fantastic too. All in all we were both full and happy, and can't wait to return for dinner soon! Great place for any location or just a treat meal for yourself!"
The best in SB!! Definitely give this place your business!! Food is authentic and service is the best. They gave my friends and I free dessert AND I saw that they pay their employees very well. Just an all around good local spot to support.
"I told you we would be back!! As always service is AMAZING AND GREAT! We came for Lunch today! We both got 2 Sides of Vegetable soup. Which was beyond delicious. If you are ever under the weather and don't want to cook some soup. Come get some soup To Go and you will not be disappointed ! :) We got the Chicken Enchiladas with Red Sauce, side of beans. And the Shredded Beef Tacos Dorados with a side of Beans. And then we ordered the addicting side of House Potatoes ! EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! Julio is an amazing server and does an excellent job taking care of us! Thank you so much for such amazing food. Be back again soon :)"
Great cocktails and oysters. Went during happy hour so can't speak about the other food but loved that you can make reservations for HH.
"We had take out breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We tried an omelette, the chipped beef dish, breakfast tacos and french toast. Everything was delish and top quality. Also the portions were large and provided me with multiple meals. Look forward to dining in soon."
I had a delicious sesame bagel with cream cheese an drink apple juice. Perfect combo of flavors. The people behind the counter welcomed me as soon as I entered and immediately. Love how unique the bagel are in size compared to other bagel places too!
"One of my favorite burgers in town! Always such a great dining experience. Everything on the menu always has you ""ooooing and ahhing""."
"My husband and I had the best NYE brunch here. With seating outside, it was a great atmosphere and great meal. There is plenty of seating indoors as well, with beautiful decor. The bathroom is eclectic and decorated nicely too. I had the lobster and chorizo omelet, which was so amazing and flavorful. My husband had a chicken sandwich and the best potato chips. There was plenty of parking around and a lot to do within walking distance. The staff was friendly and food came out in a very timely manner. Highly recommend trying this place out if in the area!"
"I personally don't like hot dogs (never really have tbh) but the ones at Steve's Hot Dogs are probably some of the best hot dogs that I have ever tasted. Everyone kept telling me to give this place a try and I can totally see why. I ordered the Bacon Bacon Jamaican which is topped with sliced crisp bacon, pepper jack cheese, jerk seasoning, bell peppers and sweet chipotle sauce. Ya'll... it was so good! My friend ordered their Macho Nacho hot dog which is topped with chili cheese sauce, tomato, sour cream, jalapeños, and crushed Doritos. He also really enjoyed his choice as well. Steve's Hot Dogs is so good that I went two days in a row. lol If you haven't been there yet, definitely stop by whenever you get the chance."
Fantastic! First time there. Host and chef were great. Food was phenomenal! Wine pairings were spot on. Will be back time and again! Tonight made life long customers out of us!
"Excellent experience. Ambiance, service and food. Chicken Angelo was amazing texture and flavor. Husband had Chicken Romano and was also very happy. Service was perfect. Tables were spaced nicely. Very cozy and elegant feeling with nice fire and decorations. I had been in past when it was busy and loud and crowded and slow. Food was still great and previous history of enjoying it there so gave them 4 stars. This Thursday night was perfect all around so feel I need to update the previous review. We will go here when we want a special evening out."
This family owned Italian Restaurant is amazing!! The entire family works together in unison to create an amazing and memorable experience. The food is divine and the service is 5 Star. A big thank you to the entire family. (Don't be deceived by the curb appeal. When you walk in you are transported to Italy.)
"There were 3 of us for NYE dinner. My friends mom tradition is to have Chinese food for NYE. She happens to live nearby and wanted to go here again. This was my first time here. We were greeted by the friendliest staff. They took my friends mom's walker and stored it while we ate. The owner pushed in her chair so she could sit closer. He came to check on us a couple of times. He also has a great sense of humour. When we scanned out QR codes he offered us some ""free alcohol"" (hand sanitizer). I liked his take on that. The place is clean, set up nicely, lots of places to sit away from others and was fun. There was different Chinese art and artifacts throughout but done nicely. Our server was sweet and friendly. We were very well taken care of. We shared szechwan beef (yum), pork chop suey, beef and broccoli and plain rice. Everything was nice and hot. Food is served on heated trays and your plate comes hot too!! At the end our server spun our wet towels (to clean sticky fingers) on her finger and tossed it onto our fingers! She said she was new to it and did a great job! There's a good amount of parking here. The sidewalks are well maintained that anyone with a cane or walker can easily access this place."
"Great atmosphere, and the service was excellent! As soon as I sat down, the waitress was quick to attend to me. The food was equally as good. I'm definitely going back a second time."
"A truly vegetarian delight! I took a Jewish friend here and I wanted to be respectable to his food needs. Since I don't know which places serve kosher meat, I typically stick with vegetarian food which I know he loves. Every single dish had a lot of good flavor. Any of these dishes could easily have been plain and so-so or not great, but Noodle 88 knows how to prepare these foods for a grand cuisine. ""88"" are lucky numbers and is traditional in Asian cultures for good luck. I've been to this restaurant many times and I feel lucky to continue to receive such delicious food!"
Best pizza in St Louis! Love it!! Go in to either Kirkwood or Webster And you get consistent great food!! Highly recommend!!!
"5 star experience! One of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to. Garlic naan is one of a kind, you should definitely try it. All entrees were delicious as well. New favorite place in the books."
"This restaurant not only has delicious food, the staff is amazing. Sara is the best waitress and Joe, the manager literally treats people as if they are family. Stranded with bad weather and no rides available, Joe drove us to our hotel. We will be sharing this act of kindness with our entire airline. Try this restaurant! You won't be disappointed. Delicious!"
I was craving some donuts and searched Yelp for a place near me that wasn't your typical chain place. Found Hole in One abs in reading the reviews I knew I had to come! They were right about getting there early. I arrived around 9:30am abs had about 5 people in front of me. The line moves pretty fast and they have one inside if you choose to wear a mask and one at their outside window. Parking lot was full also. However there is another area next door should there be no parking in the direct lot. Several menus posted on the walls and windows so you can look abs know what to want when it's yours turn. Prices pretty reasonable-- $13 for a dozen and that included 3 eclairs! Couldn't wait to get home to indulge!! My first pick was the cake donut. Wow soo good!! It's airy and moist. My fav! I've eaten the jelly filled and the glazed croissant and also tasted my hubs eclair. Eclair was really good. The filling isn't overly sweet and they donut was so soft and plain delicious. I didn't care for the glazed croissant but did really like the jelly filled. My daughter loved her chocolate frosted. Highly recommend coming here. This was my first time and I'll definitely be back!! Next I want to try their breakfast sandwiches.
I was really craving seafood but with a Vegan partner sometimes seafood restaurants don't have options for the both of us. That's when I ran into Ceviche on our walk. Bam! This was a perfect surprise. There are plentiful options and the tapas are actually larger servings than traditional tapas I am used to. The ribs slid right off the bone and the mussels were made to perfection. I couldn't stop eating the Brussels sprouts either. I highly recommend this for any dining occasion. FYI: the mussels alone could've been a full meal
White & dark chicken excellent. Slaw nice. Mac & cheese gummy. Don't order soda - their mix was off & not worth it. But chicken - chicken is off the charts. Spicy enough without overwhelming spicy
Simply the best. Do not be afraid to order dishes you've never tried before. This place is legit! Excellent value. Pro tip: (reminder) no liquor license but if you buy beer or sake or whatever at the market next door & show receipt you can enjoy an adult beverage with your meal.
"Had a juicy burger with kimchi. The fries were thick cut and delicious, and they offered good portions for happy hour! Pork buns were good too. Excited about this local spot!"
Great place tucked away in Somersett. They had live music when we went there. There was plenty of seating and the staff was friendly. Portions are generous. I'd go back.
"One of my fondest memories of living in Edmonton in the 80's. I used to try to save money by booking off work and cooking at home, it would take me at least an hour and 15 minutes to do that. Then I found out that I could go to Double Greeting, order an amazing dish for $4.00 and be in and out of there in 20 minutes! Time is money in my profession so DG helped me to save money. And the food! So tasty, I always ordered Beef Brisket on rice, sometimes Shanghai noodles, Singapore Noodles, Amoy Noodles or Rice Rolls with onion or chicken, Steamed Chicken and Soya Chicken on Rice, I remember the first time I saw a server walking by with that plate I could not believe how good it looked coming from a small town on the northern coast, I had no idea how good food could be. Also the Gai Lan with oyster sauce was always perfectly cooked. And when I had the chili oil it cured the problem I had with cold fingers and toes in the Edmonton winters! I went there after it first opened and am so happy it is still just like I remember it."
"We went for lunch on a Monday, and they had some great specials! We chose the ramen/sushi combo that got you a HUGE bowl of ramen or udon with your choice of 3 different sushi rolls. Everything was super fresh and quick to come out. We were able to take home our leftovers for lunch the next day. A must try when you're in Chinatown!"
"Excellent truffle/mushroom/onion cheesesteak, A1 cheesesteak and truffle/Parmesan fries. Steak rolls were mighty fine. Easy ordering, fast service and plenty of tables at lunch! Old City, so fun to walk and see buildings. Parking lot nearby, too."
I love this place! It is essentially going to St. Elmo with the same steaks and famous shrimp cocktail. I head here with the standard bearer is all booked up and frankly enjoy the slightly more relaxed atmosphere here to St. Elmo. They also have great Lundy specials!
"Went there on Saturday night, about5, and sat outside. My only complaint is that the TV's were too loud. Our waitress was very good but overworked, had to feel sorry for her as she worked so hard. Cocktails were good, but are cheaper during happy hour on week nights.We ordered deviled eggs, calamari, meatballs for appetizers and found them really good. For dinner we ordered shrimp and fries, duck wings and salad, fish and chips. There were over 10 fried shrimp and 4 large pieces of fish. We definitely had leftovers. The food was hot and very good. The couple sitting near us made their meals of just appetizers and they had left overs too. If I lived closer I would return."
"Every single thing we ate was amazing! And the staff was great. We forgot to take a picture of the main course, but the dessert was just as good. Also BEST lobster bisque we've ever had. Highly recommend!"
"A Chinatown gem -- I will be overjoyed if we ever get a similar location in NY. Everything here is spectacular from the fried dough to the salty tofu to the sesame balls. Affordable and extremely traditional/authentic, highly recommend as a breakfast option any day of the week."
"This review is for food, service, and ambiance because I didn't drink so I can't speak to the beer. It was a great place for lunch though, loved the Sonoran Tacos and our server was great. The location is a bit industrial but we still enjoyed sitting on the patio and looking at the mountains. I'd recommend and return!"
"Incredible food, great experience, environment is very special, everyone there is French. I highly recommend this place, it will be a special experience for you and the people you go with."
"I got the Steak Shawarma bowl and it was super flavorful. I was surprised with how fresh and clean the salad was as many places do not care about the quality of their salads before serving. The Lebanese Tea had the perfect amount of sweetness and as it was my first time trying this drink, it got me hooked and addicted. The staff was super friendly, patient, and quick on preparing food."
